 abstract = {In this paper, we find the Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to functions of least gradient. It turns out that this equation can be identified with the 1-Laplacian. Moreover, given a Lipschitz domain Ω, we prove that there exists a function of least gradient in Ω that extends every datum belonging to L1(∂Ω). We show, as well, the non-uniqueness of solutions in the case of discontinuous boundary values.},
