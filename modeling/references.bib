abstract="Experimental studies have shown that the size and infectious-stage of viral inoculum influence
disease outcomes in rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus. The possible contribution to disease outcome of antibody developed after transmission and/or present in the inoculum in free or bound form is not understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical model of virus-antibody immune complex formation and use it to predict their role in transmission and protection. The model exhibits a
bistable switch between clearance and persistence states. We fitted it to temporal virus data and estimated the parameter values for free virus infectivity rate and antibody carrying capacity for which the model transitions between virus
clearance and persistence when the initial conditions (in particular the ratio of immune complexes to free virus) vary. We used these results to quantify the minimum virus amount in the inoculum needed to establish persistent infections in the presence and absence of protective antibodies."

ABSTRACT={Recent experiments have suggested that the infectivity of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) in plasma decreases over time during primary infection. Because anti-gp41 antibodies are produced early during HIV-1 infection and form antibody-virion complexes, we studied if such early HIV-1 specific antibodies are correlated with the decay in HIV-1 infectivity. Using a viral dynamic model that allows viral infectivity to decay and frequent early viral load data obtained from 6 plasma donors we estimate that HIV-1 infectivity begins to decay after about 2 weeks of infection. The length of this delay is consistent with the time before antibody-virion complexes were detected in the plasma of these donors and is correlated (p = 0.023, r = 0.87) with the time for antibodies to be first detected in plasma. Importantly, we identify that the rate of infectivity decay is significantly correlated with the rate of increase in plasma anti-gp41 IgG concentration (p = 0.046, r = 0.82) and the increase in IgM+IgG anti-gp41 concentration (p = 8.37 x 10-4, r = 0.98). Furthermore, we found that the viral load decay after the peak did not have any significant correlation with the rate of anti-gp41 IgM or IgG increase. These results indicate that early anti-gp41 antibodies may cause viral infectivity decay, but may not contribute significantly to controlling post-peak viral load, likely due to insufficient quantity or affinity. Our findings may be helpful to devise strategies, including antibody-based vaccines, to control acute HIV-1 infection.}

During both acute and chronic Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, antibody--virion immune complexes are formed, but fail to ensure protection. In this study, we develop a mathematical model of multivalent antibody binding and use it to determine the dynamical interactions that lead to immune complexes formation and the role of complexes with increased numbers of bound antibodies in the pathogenesis of the disease. We compare our predictions with published temporal virus and immune complex data from acute infected patients. Finally, we derive quantitative and qualitative conditions needed for antibody-induced protection.",
