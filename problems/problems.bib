 abstract = {Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equation on the Euclidean space ℝ3 can be expressed in the form ∂tu = Δu + B(u, u), where B is a certain bilinear operator on divergence-free vector fields u obeying the cancellation property 〈B(u, u), u〉 = 0 (which is equivalent to the energy identity for the Navier-Stokes equation). In this paper, we consider a modification ∂tu = Δu + B̃(u, u) of this equation, where B̃ is an averaged version of the bilinear operator B (where the average involves rotations, dilations, and Fourier multipliers of order zero), and which also obeys the cancellation condition 〈B̃(u, u), u〉 = 0 (so that it obeys the usual energy identity). By analyzing a system of ordinary differential equations related to (but more complicated than) a dyadic Navier-Stokes model of Katz and Pavlovic, we construct an example of a smooth solution to such an averaged Navier-Stokes equation which blows up in finite time. This demonstrates that any attempt to positively resolve the Navier-Stokes global regularity problem in three dimensions has to use a finer structure on the nonlinear portion B(u, u) of the equation than is provided by harmonic analysis estimates and the energy identity. We also propose a program for adapting these blowup results to the true Navier-Stokes equations. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 35Q30.},

 abstract = {We study a new Radon-like transform that averages projected p- forms in R n over affine (n — k)-spaces. We then prove an explicit inversion formula for our transform on the space of rapidly-decaying smooth p-forms. Our transform differs from the one in the work by Gelfand, Graev and Shapiro (1969). Moreover, if it can be extended to a somewhat larger space of p-forms, our inversion formula will allow the synthesis of any rapidly-decaying smooth p-form on R n as a (continuous) superposition of pullbacks from p-forms on k-dimensional subspaces. In turn, such a synthesis implies an explicit formula (which we derive) for reconstructing compactly supported currents in R n (e.g., compact oriented k-dimensional subvarieties) from their oriented projections onto k-planes.},

Does this function always have a canonical optimal Lipschitz extension to all of U? We propose a notion of optimal Lipschitz extension and address existence and uniqueness in some special cases. In the case n = m = 2, we show that smooth solutions have two phases: in one they are conformal and in the other they are variants of infinity harmonic functions called infinity harmonic fans. We also prove existence and uniqueness for the extension problem on finite graphs. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
