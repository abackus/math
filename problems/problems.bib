 abstract = {Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equation on the Euclidean space ℝ3 can be expressed in the form ∂tu = Δu + B(u, u), where B is a certain bilinear operator on divergence-free vector fields u obeying the cancellation property 〈B(u, u), u〉 = 0 (which is equivalent to the energy identity for the Navier-Stokes equation). In this paper, we consider a modification ∂tu = Δu + B̃(u, u) of this equation, where B̃ is an averaged version of the bilinear operator B (where the average involves rotations, dilations, and Fourier multipliers of order zero), and which also obeys the cancellation condition 〈B̃(u, u), u〉 = 0 (so that it obeys the usual energy identity). By analyzing a system of ordinary differential equations related to (but more complicated than) a dyadic Navier-Stokes model of Katz and Pavlovic, we construct an example of a smooth solution to such an averaged Navier-Stokes equation which blows up in finite time. This demonstrates that any attempt to positively resolve the Navier-Stokes global regularity problem in three dimensions has to use a finer structure on the nonlinear portion B(u, u) of the equation than is provided by harmonic analysis estimates and the energy identity. We also propose a program for adapting these blowup results to the true Navier-Stokes equations. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 35Q30.},

 abstract = {We study a new Radon-like transform that averages projected p- forms in R n over affine (n — k)-spaces. We then prove an explicit inversion formula for our transform on the space of rapidly-decaying smooth p-forms. Our transform differs from the one in the work by Gelfand, Graev and Shapiro (1969). Moreover, if it can be extended to a somewhat larger space of p-forms, our inversion formula will allow the synthesis of any rapidly-decaying smooth p-form on R n as a (continuous) superposition of pullbacks from p-forms on k-dimensional subspaces. In turn, such a synthesis implies an explicit formula (which we derive) for reconstructing compactly supported currents in R n (e.g., compact oriented k-dimensional subvarieties) from their oriented projections onto k-planes.},
