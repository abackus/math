\section{Applications to $\infty$-harmonic functions} \label{proof of main thm}

Now we prove Theorem \ref{infinity harmonic laminations}.
Let $u$ be an $\infty$-harmonic function on a closed hyperbolic surface $M = \Hyp^2/\Gamma$, and let $L(x)$ be its local Lipschitz constant at $x$,
$$L(x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \sup_{d(x, y) < r} \frac{|u(x) - u(y)|}{d(x, y)}.$$
Let $\lambda_u(\Omega)$ be the set of maximal stretch of $u$ on a convex set $\Omega$, defined by
$$\lambda_u(\Omega) = \{x \in \Omega: L(x) = \sup_\Omega L\}.$$
Since $L$ is upper-semicontinuous and $M$ is compact, if $\Omega$ is closed then $\lambda_u(\Omega)$ is nonempty and closed.
In particular this holds for $M = \Omega$, since $M$ is the image of the fundamental domain of the Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ in $\Hyp^2$ and therefore is convex.

Let $v: M \to E$ be the harmonic conjugate of $u$; then $v$ is a section of least gradient and hence $\supp dv$ is a geodesic lamination by Theorem \ref{main thm}.
By \cite[Theorem 6.1]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, $\supp dv \subseteq \lambda_u(M)$.
Now let $x \in \lambda_u(M) \setminus \supp dv$. So there is a convex open set $\Omega$ containing $x$ on which $dv = 0$. TODO: Check the scaling $k_p$ and if it works show that $du = 0$ on $\Omega$.
