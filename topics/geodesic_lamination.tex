\begin{abstract}
The least-gradient maximum principle, essentially due to Miranda and de Giorgi in the 1960s, shows that least-gradient functions define a minimal lamination of the support of their derivative.
We show that this result still holds on hyperbolic manifolds.
As a consequence we answer some questions of Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck concerning the $L^\infty$-Teichm\"uller theory.

\section{Introduction}
Throughout this paper, let $M$ be an oriented Riemannian manifold of metric $g$ and dimension $d$.
For a function $u \in BV_\loc(M)$, we write $*|\dif u|$ for the total variation of the derivative, c.f. (\ref{total variation}).

\begin{definition}\label{main definitions}
A function $u \in BV_\loc(M)$ has \dfn{least gradient} if for every $v \in BV_\cpt(M)$ such that $\supp v \subseteq U \Subset M$,
$$\int_U *|\dif u| \leq \int_U *|\dif u + \dif v|.$$
A set $U$ of locally finite perimeter has \dfn{least perimeter} if $1_U$ has least gradient.
\end{definition}

Functions of least gradient arise naturally in conductivity imaging \cite{Nachman2009, Tamasan2019} as well as the formal limit of $p$-harmonic functions as $p \to 1$, but we are interested in them primarily because of their applications to minimal surfaces and the $L^\infty$-Teichm\"uller theory of Thurston and Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck \cite{thurston1998minimal,daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
In that context one is interested in the existence of minimal laminations in a closed hyperbolic manifold, as defined below:

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{minimal lamination} in $M$ is a partition of a closed subset of $M$ into smooth hypersurfaces with zero mean curvature.
The minimal lamination $\lambda$ is \dfn{analytic} if $(M, g)$ is analytic and each of the hypersurfaces in $\lambda$ is analytic.
\end{definition}

Our first theorem is an analogue of the maximum principle for least gradient functions on euclidean space \cite[Proposition 3.4]{górny2017planar}.

\begin{theorem}[maximum principle]\label{main thm}
Suppose that $2 \leq d \leq 7$ and suppose that $M$ has negative constant curvature.
Let $u: M \to \RR$ be a function of least gradient, and $A_y = \partial \{u > y\}$.
Then $(A_y)_{y \in \RR}$ is an analytic minimal lamination in $M$.
\end{theorem}

Theorem \ref{main thm} partially answers a question \cite[Problem 9.5]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} of Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck; we state this as Corollary \ref{maximum stretch contains lamination}.
Moreover, in the course of proving Theorem \ref{main thm}, we shall obtain as a byproduct a solution to \cite[Problem 9.7]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, namely Corollary \ref{ruelle sullivan antiderivative}.

Theorem \ref{main thm} is a consequence of the following regularity theorem for sets of least perimeter.

\begin{theorem}[regularity of minimal hypersurfaces]\label{main lma}
Suppose that $2 \leq d \leq 7$.
Then every set of least perimeter in $\Hyp^d$ is bounded by an analytic minimal hypersurface $N$.
\end{theorem}

Analogous results to Theorem \ref{main lma} include regularity of minimal currents weighted by an elliptic integrand, proven by Federer \cite[\S5.3]{federer2014geometric}, and regularity of sets of least perimeter on $\RR^d$ developed by Miranda \cite{Miranda64, Miranda66, Miranda67}.
Our strategy closely mirrors Miranda's, and in this paper we emphasize the steps of the proof where significant modifications of Miranda's arguments are necessary.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{main thm}]
We first pass to the universal cover of $M$, which is an open subset of $\Hyp^d$.
By Corollary \ref{level sets are minimal}, for every function $u$ of least gradient, the superlevel sets of $u$ have least perimeter.
Let
\begin{equation}\label{lamination union}
A = \bigcup_y \partial \{u > y\},
\end{equation}
let $B$ be the interior of $\{du = 0\}$, and let $x \in M$.
Then $x \in B$ iff $u = u(x)$ near $x$, but that happens iff for every $y < u(x)$, $x$ is interior to $\{u > y\}$ and for every $y \geq u(x)$, $x$ is exterior to $\{u > y\}$.
This happens iff for every $y \in \RR$, $x$ is either interior or exterior to $\{u > y\}$, thus $x \notin \partial \{u > y\}$, which happens iff $x \notin A$.
Thus $\{A, B\}$ is a partition of $M$, so $A$ is closed.
Moreover, the sets $\{u > y\}$ are totally ordered by $\subseteq$, so the sets $\partial \{u > y\}$ are disjoint.
They are also hypersurfaces with the desired amount of regularity, by Theorem \ref{main lma}.
\end{proof}

It was shown by G\'orny that functions of least gradient on $\RR^d$, $d \leq 7$, have a decomposition into continuous and jump parts \cite[Theorem 1.2]{górny2017planar}.
We assert that given Theorem \ref{main thm}, the proof of this result goes through verbatim:

\begin{theorem}[G\'orny's regularity theorem]\label{Gorny regularity}
Let $U$ be an open bounded convex subset of a hyperbolic manifold of dimension $\leq 7$.
Then any function of least gradient $u: U \to \RR$ can be written as the sum of a continuous function of least gradient, and a function of least gradient with only jump discontinuities.
\end{theorem}

TODO: Check this very carefully

\subsection{Applications to hyperbolic geometry}
In this section we discuss applications to Teichm\"uller theory and hyperbolic computational geometry.

The Thurston asymmetric metric, first defined in \cite{thurston1998minimal}, is constructed from best-Lipschitz maps between two closed hyperbolic manifolds.
As a first step towards an analytic understanding of the Thurston asymmetric metric, Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse} considered best-Lipschitz maps $M \to S^1$ where $M$ is a closed hyperbolic surface.
They identified a particularly important class of such maps, the $\infty$-harmonic maps, defined as follows, which are particularly significant because they induce geodesic laminations of $M$.

\begin{definition}
If a function $u$ is the weak limit in $L^r$ for $r > d$ of $p$-harmonic functions as $p \to \infty$, we call $u$ \dfn{$\infty$-harmonic}.
For an $\infty$-harmonic function $u$ we define the \dfn{maximum-stretch locus}
$$\lambda_u := \{x \in M: L(x) = \sup L\}$$
where $L(x)$ denotes the local Lipschitz constant of $u$ at $x$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{infinity harmonic laminations}
Suppose that $M$ is a closed hyperbolic surface and $u$ is an $\infty$-harmonic function. Then the maximum-stretch locus $\lambda_u$ is a geodesic lamination in $M$.
\end{theorem}

In \cite[\S5]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck prove the above theorem by considering the viscosity solution theory of $\infty$-Laplace equation
\begin{equation}\label{infinity laplace}
    \Hess u(\grad u, \grad u) = 0.
\end{equation}
However, the theory of viscosity solutions of (\ref{infinity laplace}) is still nascent, and Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck ask for a proof of Theorem \ref{infinity harmonic laminations} that bypasses (\ref{infinity laplace}) altogether, c.f. \cite[Problem 9.5]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
We give a partial resolution of this problem by proving \cite[Theorem-Conjecture 9.6]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Before stating it we note that by a \dfn{section of least gradient} $u$ we mean a section that lifts to a section $\tilde u$ on $\Hyp^d$, such that $\tilde u$ can be trivialized to a function of least gradient

\begin{corollary}\label{maximum stretch contains lamination}
Let $u$ be an $\infty$-harmonic function on a closed hyperbolic surface $M$.
Then the maximum-stretch locus $\lambda_u$ contains a geodesic lamination.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By \cite[\S6]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}\footnote{The proof that such a section exists does not use Theorem \ref{infinity harmonic laminations}.}, there exists an affine bundle $E \to M$ and a section $v$ of least gradient of $E$ such that $\supp \dif v \subseteq \lambda_u$.
By Theorem \ref{main thm}, $\supp \dif v$ is a geodesic lamination.
\end{proof}

It is not clear that $\supp \dif v = \lambda_u$ in the above corollary, essentially because it is not clear that the map $\dif u \mapsto \dif v$ is locally injective (so $\dif v$ could be $0$ somewhere on $\lambda_u$).
We believe that this should be true, and state this as Conjecture \ref{two laminations agree}.

Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck also ask for a partial converse to the fact that $\dif v$ endows $\lambda_u$ with the structure of an oriented measured lamination.
We now prove this, resolving \cite[Problem 9.7]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
For the definition of the Ruelle-Sullivan $1$-current of an oriented, transversely measured geodesic lamination, see \cite[\S8]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} or the original paper of Ruelle--Sullivan \cite{Ruelle75}.

\begin{proposition}\label{minimal bounding implies least gradient}
Let $u \in BV_\loc(M)$, where $M$ is a hyperbolic manifold, and suppose that the level sets $\partial \{u > y\}$ define a minimal lamination.
Then $u$ is a function of least gradient.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Fix $U \Subset M$ and let $v$ be a competitor in $U$, thus $v \in BV(U)$ and $u - v$ is trace-free.
Then for $T: BV(U) \to L^1(U)$ the trace map, $\{Tu > y\} = \{Tv > y\}$ by (\ref{convergence of trace}).
It follows that $\partial^* \{v > y\}$ is a competitor to $\partial \{u > y\}$ in $U$ and hence, since $\partial \{u > y\}$ is minimal,
$$|\partial^* \{u > y\} \cap U| \leq |\partial^* \{v > y\} \cap U|.$$
That $u$ has least gradient now follows from the coarea formula, Proposition \ref{coarea formula}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{ruelle sullivan antiderivative}
Let $\lambda$ be an oriented, transversely measured geodesic lamination on a closed hyperbolic surface $M$, and let $\dif v$ be the Ruelle-Sullivan $1$-current induced by $\lambda$.
Then $\dif v$ is the derivative of a section of least gradient $v: M \to E$, for some affine bundle $E \to M$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
As observed in \cite[\S9]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, if we lift $\dif v$ to a $1$-current $\dif \tilde v$ on $\Hyp^2$, then $\dif \tilde v$ is exact and any antiderivative $\tilde v$ of $\dif \tilde v$ has superlevel sets $\{\tilde v \geq y\}$ which are bounded by geodesics.
Moreover we can choose $\tilde v$ to be $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant.
The claim now follows from Proposition \ref{minimal bounding implies least gradient} and the realization of $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant functions on $\Hyp^2$ as sections of an affine bundle, c.f. \cite[\S4]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
\end{proof}

Moreover, if $M \to \Sph^1$ is a fibration where $M$ is a closed hyperbolic manifold of dimension $\leq 7$, then we may view the maps of least gradient $u: M \to \Sph^1$ as sections of least gradient of some affine bundle over $M$.
As our results apply to such sections we obtain a partial resolution of \cite[Problem 9.13]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.

When combined with work of Loisel \cite{Loisel20}, Theorem \ref{main thm} also finds application in computational hyperbolic geometry, as it furnishes a large class of minimal laminations which are inexpensive to compute.

\begin{proposition}\label{cohomology makes laminations}
Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic manifold of dimension $d \leq 7$, and let $\alpha \in H^1(M, \RR)$.
Then there is a natural minimal lamination $\lambda$ in $M$ induced by $\alpha$, which can be obtained by solving a least-gradient Dirichlet problem on a fundamental polytope of $M$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\Gamma = \pi_1(M)$. The Hurcewiz theorem and the universal property of abelianization furnish a commutative diagram
$$\begin{tikzcd}\Gamma \arrow[dr, "\exists!"] \arrow[r] & H_1(M) \arrow[d, "\alpha"] \\ & \RR\end{tikzcd}$$
We also denote the unique map $\Gamma \to \RR$ in the above diagram by $\alpha$.
Then $\alpha$ is a representation of $\Gamma$ and thus induces a space $E$ of equivariant functions on the boundary $\Omega$ of each fundamental polytope $\Omega$ of $\Gamma$. To be more precise, for every $f \in E$ and $\gamma \in \Gamma$,
\begin{equation}\label{boundary data for Loisel}
f(\gamma x) = f(x) + \alpha(\gamma),
\end{equation}
and $f$ is constant on each face of $\partial \Omega$.
The relation (\ref{boundary data for Loisel}) is an underdetermined boundary condition for functions in $E$, and so we consider the subspace $E'$ of functions which in addition are zero on a maximal set of faces such that we do not determine $f|\partial \Omega = 0$, thus any function $E' \subseteq E$ has a completely determined trace $t$ on $\partial \Omega$.
It follows from \cite[Theorem 4.4]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} that there exists a function $u$ of least gradient on $\Omega$ whose trace is $t$.
The minimal lamination induced by a function $u \in E$ of least gradient from Theorem \ref{main thm} does not depend on the class of $u$ in $E/E'$, since that is a space of constants; so we obtain a uniquely defined minimal lamination of $M$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
With $M, \alpha, \lambda$ as in Proposition \ref{cohomology makes laminations}, and every quasiuniform triangulation $T$ of $M$, there exists a numerical algorithm for computing $\lambda$ with finite elements in $T$ with time complexity $O(|T|^{1/2} \log |T|)$ where $|\cdot|$ is cardinality.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By \cite[Theorem 1]{Loisel20}, one can solve the least-gradient Dirichlet problem with finite elements in $T$ with time complexity $O(|T|^{1/2} \log |T|)$.
\end{proof}

TODO: Do some numerical experiments, show what minimal laminations in a fundamental polytope in $\Hyp^3$ look like


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Some open problems}
We believe that Theorem \ref{main lma} could be extended to a wider class of Riemannian manifolds:

\begin{conjecture}\label{main conj}
Suppose that $2 \leq d \leq 7$ and $M$ is a simply connected Riemannian $d$-fold. Then Theorem \ref{main lma} holds with $\Hyp^d$ replaced by $M$.
\end{conjecture}

This conjecture implies Theorem \ref{main thm} for arbitrary $M$ by passing to the universal cover.
Since our proof strongly uses the symmetries of $\Hyp^d$, it would be reasonable to first try to prove Conjecture \ref{main conj} for locally homogeneous manifolds, and especially those locally homogeneous manifolds $M$ such that for every $P \in M$ there is a natural action of $\Orth(\RR^d)$ on $M$ by isometry that fixes $P$.
Another line of attack would be to show that our methods are perturbative, so that if $(M, g)$ is a simply connected Riemannian manifold such that $g$ is ``close to constant negative curvature'' in some sense, then Conjecture \ref{main conj} holds for $(M, g)$.

It seems highly unlikely that Theorem \ref{main lma} can be extended to $\Hyp^8$, due to the existence of Simons cones in $\RR^8$ \cite[Theorem A]{BOMBIERI1969}.
Simons cones are not of least perimeter in $\Hyp^8$, but one could potentially perturb them to obtain a set of least perimeter whose boundary is singular:

\begin{problem}
    Construct a set $U$ of least perimeter in $\Hyp^8$ such that $\partial U$ has a singularity of codimension $8$.
\end{problem}

Owing to the G\'orny regularity theorem, Theorem \ref{Gorny regularity}, we suspect that its consequence \cite[Theorem 1.1]{górny2017planar} holds, giving well-posedness for the Dirichlet problem in strictly convex planar domains.
However, this is not obvious as we have not extended the Sternberg--Williams--Ziemer theorem \cite{ZiemerWilliamsSternberg1992} to the hyperbolic case.
We therefore state G\'orny's main theorem as a conjecture:

\begin{conjecture}
Let $U$ be an open, bounded, strictly convex subset of $\Hyp^2$ with $C^1$ boundary.
Then there exists a solution of the least-gradient Dirichlet problem on $U$ with data in $BV(\partial U)$.
\end{conjecture}

We would also like to know that the $\infty$-harmonic/least-gradient duality gives a complete proof of Theorem \ref{infinity harmonic laminations}, which follows from the below conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}\label{two laminations agree}
Let $u$ be an $\infty$-harmonic function with dual least-gradient section $v$.
Then $\supp \dif v = \lambda_u$.
\end{conjecture}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Outline of the paper}
We begin with the preliminaries in \S\ref{LeastGradientFunctions} by developing the theory of functions of least gradient on Riemannian manifolds. A generalization of Miranda's theorem \cite[Teorema 3]{Miranda67} on the stability of functions of least gradient, and generalizations of its standard consequences, easily fall out.
In particular, we show that the tangent cone to a set of least perimeter exists and is a hyperplane.
In \S\ref{Monotonicity} we show that a monotonicity formula and several of its standard consequences hold for sets of least perimeter.

We are then ready to prove Theorem \ref{main lma}.
In \S\ref{MollifierSection}, we show Proposition \ref{mollifier quant}, which says that a set of least perimeter can be approximated by $C^1$ hypersurfaces that are approximately minimal.
This result is then used in \S\ref{DeGiorgiSection} to prove Theorem \ref{main lma}. We do this by proving an analogue of the de Giorgi regularity lemma \cite[Teorema 5.7]{Miranda66} for $\Hyp^d$. The de Giorgi lemma is the only point of the proof where we use the constant negative curvature of $M$.
We rely on the transitivity of $\Iso(\Hyp^d)$ as well as the fact that one can represent hypersurfaces in $\Hyp^d$ on euclidean space in a way which approximately preserves the surface area and normal vector field.
