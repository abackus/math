\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this paper is to record several modes of convergence for laminations, and in particular for minimal laminations, for use in the companion papers \cite{BackusFLG, DaskalopoulosPrep2}.
In such papers it is crucial that a disjoint family of minimal hypersurfaces without boundary -- which we refer to as a \dfn{minimal partition} -- is in fact a minimal lamination.
However this is false in general, as we will discuss, and so we will use the compactness theory discussed in this paper as well as the stable Bernstein theorem \cite{Schoen2016, Chodosh2021} to give a criterion under which a minimal partition is a lamination.

Most of the modes of convergence in this paper and their compactness theorems have been known to various sources \cite{ColdingMinicozziIV, ColdingMinicozziV, thurston1979geometry}.
Our contribution is to synthesize the known results, explaining under what circumstances different modes of convergence are stronger than others, as well as under what circumstances a sequence of laminations has a convergent subsequence.

\section{Preliminaries}
\begin{definition}
Let $S$ be a nonempty closed subset of a smooth manifold $M$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A (codimension $1$) \dfn{flow box} for $S$ is a $C^0$ chart in which $S$ can be expressed as $K \times \RR^{d - 1} \subseteq \RR^d$ for some closed $K \subseteq [-1, 1]$.
\item The closed set $K$ is called a \dfn{leaf space}. Its fibers are called \dfn{leaves}, and the \dfn{label} of the fiber $\{k\} \times \RR^{d - 1}$ is $k$.
\item A \dfn{lamination} $\lambda$ in $M$, with support $S$, consists of an atlas of lamination flow boxes for $S$, whose transition maps preserve the local product structure, such that the leaves are $C^2$ hypersurfaces in $M$.
\item A \dfn{plaque} of $\lambda$ is a connected component of $M \setminus S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We shall write a flow box as 
$$F_\alpha: [-1, 1] \times \RR^{d - 1} \to M$$
where $\alpha$ ranges over some atlas $A$, and denote the associated leaf space by $K_\alpha \subseteq [-1, 1]$.
The transition maps will be denoted $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$, and are characterized by
\begin{equation}\label{transition relation}
F_\alpha = F_\beta \circ \psi_{\alpha \beta}
\end{equation}
wherever both sides of (\ref{transition relation}) are defined.
Since the transition maps are required to preserve the local product structure $K_\alpha \times \RR^{d - 1}$, they induce self-maps of $K_\alpha \cap K_\beta$ that we also denote by $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$ if no confusion can result.

We assume that the leaves are $C^2$ in order to ensure that the normal vectors to each leaves are well-defined in $C^1$.
In \cite{Morgan88}, such laminations are called $C^2$ \dfn{along leaves}.
This is not the same thing as assuming that the lamination admits a $C^2$ atlas, as it may not be able to extend the normal vectors to each leaf to a $C^1$ vector field on $M$ even locally; see \S\ref{RegularitySec} for more precise assertions about regularity.
This assumption in particular ensures that the second fundamental forms, and hence mean curvatures, to each leaf are well-defined in $C^0$.

It seems rather difficult to say much about convergence of general laminations, as we will give several examples to illustrate.
However, the situation improves significantly if the laminations in question are minimal:

\begin{definition}
Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold.
A lamination $\lambda$ is \dfn{minimal} if every leaf of $\lambda$ has zero mean curvature, and is \dfn{geodesic} if in addition $M$ is a surface.
\end{definition}

A lamination is geodesic iff its leaves are geodesics.

Control on the second fundamental forms will be a crucial assumption throughout this paper and so we make the following definition:

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{maximal curvature} of a lamination $\lambda$ is
$$R_\lambda := \sup_N ||\Two_N||_{C^0}$$
where $N$ ranges over leaves of $\lambda$ and $\Two_N$ is the second fundamental form of $N$.
\end{definition}

The maximal curvature of a geodesic lamination is $0$.
For a minimal lamination in a threefold $M$, $R_\lambda$ is instead controlled by the Gauss curvature of the leaves of $\lambda$ and the Ricci curvature of $M$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Topological conditions on laminations}
Let us now identify some useful topological conditions one may put on laminations.
Before doing so, we recall some elementary point-set topology, as in \cite[Chapter 2]{Pugh02}.
A \dfn{Polish space} is a second-countable topological space which admits a complete metric. 
This condition shall be useful for us because every leaf space $K_\alpha$ is Polish.
A Polish space is \dfn{perfect} if it has no isolated points, and \dfn{totally disconnected} if every component of $X$ is singleton.

\begin{definition}
Let $\lambda$ be a lamination in $M$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\lambda$ is \dfn{discrete}, \dfn{perfect}, or \dfn{totally disconnected}, if the same property holds of every leaf space of $\lambda$.
\item $\lambda$ is \dfn{finite} if every leaf of $\lambda$ is closed, and $\lambda$ has only finitely many leaves.
\item $\lambda$ is a \dfn{foliation} if $\supp \lambda = M$.
\item $\lambda$ is \dfn{absolutely continuous} if we can choose an atlas so that every leaf space of $\lambda$ is connected.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Every finite lamination is discrete, and every discrete lamination is totally disconnected.
Conversely, a discrete lamination in a closed manifold, or a perfect discrete lamination, is finite.
However, a lamination with finitely many leaves need not be finite, even if it is geodesic:

\begin{example}\label{two geodesics}
Let $M = \RR \times \Sph^1$ be a cylinder.
We may choose a metric on $M$ so that there is a geodesic $\gamma_1$ which is a simple closed curve looping around $M$, and that there is another geodesic $\gamma_2$ which winds around $M$ infinitely many times, converging to $\gamma_1$.
TODO: Make a picture.
Then $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ form a geodesic lamination with two leaves which is not finite.
This example, and slight modifications thereof, will be frequently useful as a counterexample throughout this paper.
\end{example}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Regularity of minimal laminations}\label{RegularitySec}
Though we impose that laminations are $C^0$ (in the sense that their flow boxes are $C^0$) we can improve this regularity in the case of minimal laminations.
In this section we follow \cite{Solomon86}, which treats the special case that $\lambda$ is a minimal foliation of $M \subseteq \RR^d$.

\begin{theorem}\label{regularity theorem}
Let $\lambda$ be a minimal lamination. Then $\lambda$ admits a Lipschitz atlas.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
TODO
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Lipschitz regularity is optimal, even in the nicest possible case of a geodesic foliation of a complete Riemannian manifold.
Indeed, let $M = B((2, 0), 1)$ in $\RR^2$. Then the chords $\{y = ax\}$ for $a > 0$ and $\{y = a\}$ for $a \leq 0$ define a foliation $\lambda$ of $M$.
If we equip $M$ with the Beltrami-Klein metric, then, since the leaves of $\lambda$ are chords, $\lambda$ defines a geodesic foliation of $M \cong \Hyp^2$.
Moreover the conormal to the foliation is
$$\normal = \frac{1_{y > 0}}{\sqrt{1 + y^2/x^2}} \left[\dif y - \frac{y}{x} \dif x\right] + 1_{y \leq 0} \dif y$$
which is not $C^1$.
TODO: Make a picture
\end{example}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Global space of leaves}
We now put a topology on the set $\Leaves \lambda$ of all leaves of a lamination $\lambda$ in a closed manifold, so that $\Leaves \lambda$ is a compact Hausdorff space.

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a compact metric space. The \dfn{Hausdorff distance} between two closed sets $A, B \subset X$ is
$$\dist(A, B) := \max\left(\max_{a \in A} \min_{b \in B} \dist(a, b), \max_{b \in B} \min_{a \in A} \dist(a, b)\right).$$
The space of closed subsets of $X$ is the \dfn{hyperspace} $\Hypspace X$.
\end{definition}

The fact that we restrict $X$ to be compact is motivated by the following example.

\begin{example}
Consider $\Hyp^2$ with its disk model in $\CC$, and let $\gamma$ be the horizontal geodesic through the origin $0$.
Consider also a sequence of geodesics $(\gamma_j)$ through $i/j$ which are horizontal at $i/j$.
Then $\lambda_j \to \lambda$ in Thurston's geometric topology and in Hausdorff distance.
However,
$$\dist_{\mathscr H(\Hyp^2)}(\gamma_j, \gamma) = \infty.$$
Indeed, one can find points $x$ on $\gamma$ which are arbitrarily close to the circle at infinity $\partial \Hyp^2$.
Let $\rho$ be the geodesic which is orthogonal to $\gamma$ at $x$.
Then the segment of $\rho$ between $\gamma$ and $\gamma_j$ would become arbitrarily long as $x \to \partial \Hyp^2$.
\end{example}

For compact $X$, however, one can give a homeomorphism-invariant definition of the topology of $\Hypspace X$ \cite[Chapter 4]{nadler2017continuum}, and from that definition it follows that $\Hypspace X$ is a compact metric space.
In particular, $\Hypspace$ is a self-map of the class of compact metrizable spaces.
Moreover, if $K_i \to K$ in $\Hypspace X$, then $K$ is the set of limits of sequences $(k_i)$ such that $k_i \in K_i$.

These properties make it suitable to define $\Leaves \lambda$ to be a certain closed subset of $\Hypspace M$:

\begin{definition}
If $\lambda$ is a lamination in a closed manifold $M$, we let $\Leaves \lambda$ be the subset of $\Hypspace M$ whose elements are closed sets $\overline N$ where $N$ is a leaf of $\lambda$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
For any lamination $\lambda$, $\Leaves \lambda$ is in canonical bijection with the set of all leaves of $\lambda$, and is a closed subset of $\Hypspace M$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Clearly the map $N \mapsto \overline N$ is a canonical surjection from the set of leaves of $\lambda$ to $\Leaves \lambda$.
In fact, it is injective as well: if $\overline N = \overline{N'}$, then for any sequence $(x_i)$ in $N$ such that $x_i \to x$ in $M$, there exists a sequence $(x_i')$ in $N'$ such that $x_i' \to x$.
Moreover (possibly after discarding finitely many entries in the sequence) we may assume that these limits take place inside some flow box with image $U_\alpha$, so there are co-Cauchy sequences $(k, y_i)$ and $(k', y_i')$ in $\RR \times \RR^{d - 1}$, where $k, k'$ are the labels of $N, N'$ respectively.
This is only possible if $k = k'$ and so $N \cap U_\alpha = N' \cap U_\alpha$.
After covering $M$ by flow boxes we see that $N = N'$ and so the canonical map is injective.

Now if $(N_i)$ is a sequence in $\Leaves \lambda$ which converges to some closed set $N \in \Hypspace M$, then $N \in \Hypspace(\supp \lambda)$.
Indeed, $\supp \lambda$ is a compact subset of $M$, so $\Hypspace(\supp \lambda)$ is compact, and hence is a closed subset of $\Hypspace M$.
In any flow box $U$, the sets $N_i \cap U$ take the form $\{k_i\} \times \RR^{d - 1}$, and any limit of such sets must of the form $\{k\} \times \RR^{d - 1}$.
So $N \cap U$ is a leaf of the restriction of $\lambda$ to $U$.
It follows that $N \in \Leaves \lambda$.
\end{proof}

% \subsection{Intersection theory for geodesic laminations}

% \begin{proposition}\label{construction of ruelle sullivan currents}
% Let $\lambda$ be a lamination, $\omega$ a $d-1$-current which is normal to $\lambda$, and $(\chi_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}$ a partition of unity subordinate to an atlas of flow boxes for $\lambda$ which is cooriented with $\omega$ and leaf spaces $(K_\alpha)$.
% Then $\mu := \star |\omega|$ is a transverse measure to $\lambda$, such that for every continuous $d-1$-form $\varphi$ of compact support,
% $$\int_M \omega \wedge \varphi = \sum_{\alpha \in A} \int_{K_\alpha} \int_{N_{\alpha k}} \chi_\alpha \varphi \dif \mu_\alpha(k)$$
% where $N_{\alpha k}$ denotes the $k$th leaf in the $\alpha$th flow box.
% \end{proposition}

% \begin{definition}
% The current $\omega$ of Proposition \ref{construction of ruelle sullivan currents} associated to the oriented measured lamination $(\lambda, \mu)$ is called the \dfn{Ruelle-Sullivan current} associated to $(\lambda, \mu)$.
% \end{definition}

% TODO: Currents and orientations. What does it mean for a current to be normal? and cooriented?
% Alternatively, maybe all this stuff should go in the FLG paper. I'm not sure.

\section{The modes of convergence}
\subsection{Thurston's geometric topology}
We now recall the ``geometric topology'' introduced by Thurston \cite[\S8.10]{thurston1998minimal}.
To state it we let $\normal_N(x)$ denote the unit-length conormal $1$-form to a hypersurface $N$ at a point $x$ with respect to some Riemannian metric.

\begin{definition}
A sequence of laminations $\lambda_i$ converges to $\lambda$ in \dfn{Thurston's geometric topology} if, for every leaf $N$ of $\lambda$, every $x \in N$, and every $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find arbitrarily large $i \in \NN$, a leaf $N_i$ of $\lambda_i$, and $x_i \in N_i$, such that $\dist(x_i, x) < \varepsilon$ and $|\normal_{N_i}(x) - \normal_N(x)| < \varepsilon$.
\end{definition}

It is straightforward to see that this topology does not depend on the Riemannian metric, or on the choice of trivialization that was used to make sense of the convergence $\normal_{N_i}(x_i) \to \normal_N(x)$.
It is also straightforward to see that if $\lambda_i \to \lambda$ and $\lambda' \subseteq \lambda$ then $\lambda_i \to \lambda'$.
Thus Thurston's geometric topology is very far from Hausdorff.
To deal with the lack of uniqueness of limits we single out the special case that we have a privileged choice of limit:

\begin{definition}
If $\lambda_i \to \lambda$ in Thurston's geometric topology, and for every lamination $\lambda'$, $\lambda_i \to \lambda'$ iff $\lambda' \subseteq \lambda$, we say that $\lambda$ is the \dfn{maximal limit} of $(\lambda_i)$ in Thurston's geometric topology.
\end{definition}

If a maximal limit exists, it is unique.
However one may consider the case that there are two limiting laminations whose leaves intersect to see that there need not exist a maximal limit.

Since Thurston's geometric topology requires convergence of normal vector fields pointwise, it ``respects the regularity of the flow boxes" in some sense.
On the other hand this makes it somewhat hard to prove convergence in this topology.

\begin{lemma}\label{transverse at one implies transverse at all}
Let $\lambda$ be a minimal lamination, $N$ a leaf of $\lambda$, $x \in N$, and $\gamma$ a geodesic which intersects $N$ at $x$ transversely.
Then for every leaf $\tilde N$ whose label is close to $N$ in a Lipschitz flow box near $x$, $\gamma$ intersects $\tilde N$ transversely at a point near $x$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since Lipschitz maps preserve transversality TODO, we may replace $\lambda$ with a lamination in $[0, 1] \times \RR^{d - 1}$, so that $N$ corresponds to $\{0\} \times \RR^{d - 1}$ and $N'$ corresponds to $\{k\} \times \RR$, where $0 < k \ll 1$ depending on $\gamma$.
In this flow box, $\gamma$ corresponds to the graph $\{t = f(k)\}$ of a Lipschitz map $f$ taking a neighborhood of $0 \in \RR$ into $\RR^{d - 1}$.
If $k$ is small enough, then $k$ is contained in the domain of $f$, so $\gamma$ is transverse to the fiber of $k$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $(\lambda_i)$ be a sequence of geodesic laminations, and $\lambda$ a geodesic lamination, such that for every leaf $N$ of $\lambda$ and every $x \in \NN$, there exists a transverse geodesic $\gamma$ to $N$ at $x$ such that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find $i \in \NN$, a leaf $N_i$ of $\lambda_i$, and $x_i \in N_i$, such that $\dist(x_i, x) < \varepsilon$ and $\gamma$ is transverse to $N_i$ at $x_i$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{transverse at one implies transverse at all} and Theorem \ref{regularity theorem}, $\gamma$ is transverse to leaves of $\lambda$ (possibly after replacing $M$ with a small neighborhood of $x$).
For each $k$ such that $\gamma(k) \in \supp \lambda$, we let $X(k) \in T_{\gamma(k)} M$ be unit length and tangent to the leaf of $\lambda$ which contains $\gamma(k)$.
Then we may extend $X$ to a Lipschitz vector field along $\gamma$, and set
$$F(k, t) := \exp_{\gamma(k)}(tX(k)).$$
So $F$ is a Lipschitz flow box.
Working in the coordinates given by $F$, $N_i$ is transverse to $\{t = 0\}$, so it is the graph $\{k = f_i(t)\}$ of a Lipschitz function $f_i$ defined near $0 \in \RR$.
Moreover, $f_i(0) \to f(0)$.
We claim that $\dif f_i(0) \to \dif f(0)$; if not,
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $(\lambda_i)$ be a sequence of geodesic laminations in a closed surface $M$, and $\lambda$ a lamination such that $\Leaves \lambda_i \to \Leaves \lambda$ in $\Hypspace^2 M$.
Then $\lambda$ is a maximal limit of $(\lambda_i)$ in Thurston's geometric topology.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

From this lemma and the compactness of $\Hypspace^2 M$ (we can prove compactness of $\Hypspace^k M$ by induction on $k$) we have:

\begin{proposition}
Every sequence of geodesic laminations in a closed surface has a subsequence which converges to a maximal limit in Thurston's geometric topology.
\end{proposition}

Minimality is a crucial hypothesis in the characterization of Thurston's geometric topology by Hausdorff distance:

\begin{example}
Let $f_i$ be a smooth approximation to the Dirac measure $\delta_{1/2-1/i}$ at $1/2 - 1/i$ with compact support in $(1/2 - 2/i, 1/2)$, so $f_i \to 0$ pointwise.
Let $\lambda_i$ be the lamination consisting of the graph of $f_i$ in $\RR^2$ and $\lambda$ the lamination consisting of the horizontal line through $0$.
Then $\lambda_i$ converges to $\lambda$ in Thurston's geometric topology but not in Hausdorff distance.
TODO: Include a picture
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{Hausdorff does not imply Thurston}
Consider the sequence of continuous functions $f_i: \RR \to \RR$ where $f_i$ is constant away from $[0, 1/i^2]$, is $0$ on $(-\infty, 0]$, is $1/i$ on $[1/i^2, \infty)$, and is linear on $[0, 1/i^2]$.
By smoothing out the graphs of $f_i$ appropriately one obtains a sequence of $C^1$ curves $\gamma_i$ in $\RR^2$, whose geodesic curvatures blow up near $(0, 0)$, and if we set $\lambda_i$ to be the union of $\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_i$, then $(\lambda_i)$ is a sequence of laminations which converges in Hausdorff distance but not in Thurston's geometric topology.
TODO: Include a picture.
\end{example}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The weak topology of measures}
Another topology in common use is the weak topology on measures on the space of measured laminations, due to Thurston \cite[Chapter 8]{thurston1998minimal}.
To state it, we recall the notion of a transverse measure.
These are certain Radon measures on the leaf spaces; to study them it will be useful to recall some facts about Radon measures on Polish spaces TODO Cite it.

Let $X$ be a Polish space.
The space $C_0(X)$ of continuous functions $f: X \to \RR$ such that $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 0$ is canonically isomorphic to the direct limit $\varinjlim C(Y)$ of continuous functions $f: Y \to \RR$ where $Y$ ranges over all compact subsets of $X$ and the bonding maps are inclusions.
Since $C(Y)$ is a Banach space, the identification $C_0(X) = \varinjlim C(Y)$ endows $C_0(X)$ with the structure of a locally convex space.
If $X$ is in fact compact, then this direct limit is trivial and so $C(X) = C_0(X)$.
Its dual $C_0(X)'$ is canonically isomorphic to the space of signed Radon measures on $X$.

\begin{definition}
The weak topology on $C_0(X)'$ is known as the \dfn{weak topology of measures}.
\end{definition}

Unpacking the definitions, a sequence $(\mu_i)$ of Radon measures converges to $\mu$ in the weak topology of measures iff for every compact $Y \subseteq X$ and every continuous function $f: Y \to \RR$,
$$\lim_{i \to \infty} \int_Y f \dif \mu_i = \int_Y f \dif \mu.$$
The same thing works for currents.
The advantage of the weak topology is its compactness.

\begin{proposition}[Prokohorov compactness theorem]
If $X$ is a compact Polish space, then any closed set $S \subseteq C(X)'$ such that $\sup_{\mu \in S} \mu(X) < \infty$ is compact.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
TODO Cite 
\end{proof}

Having topologized the space of Radon measures, we define what it means for such a measure to be transverse to a lamination:

% If we have a second locally compact Polish space $Y$, equipped with a Radon measure $\mu \in C_0(Y)'$ and a Borel map $\pi: Y \to X$, we can view $Y$ as a ``measure-theoretic fiber bundle'' over $X$ by equipping $X$ with the pushforward measure
% $$\pi_* \mu(E) := \mu(\pi^{-1}(E)).$$

% \begin{lemma}[disintegration theorem]
% Each fiber $Y_x := \pi^{-1}(x)$ naturally carries the structure of a measured space, where the measure $\mu_x$ on $Y_x$ characterized by the formula
% $$\int_Y f \dif \mu = \int_X \int_{Y_x} f(y) \dif \mu_x(y) \dif \pi_* \mu(x)$$
% for every $f \in C_0(Y)$.
% \end{lemma}
% TODO: Cite this, if we actually need it

\begin{definition}
Let $\lambda$ be a lamination with atlas $A$.
A \dfn{transverse measure} to $\lambda$ consists of Radon measures $\mu_\alpha$ with $\supp \mu_\alpha = K_\alpha$, $\alpha \in A$, such that each transition map $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$ is measure-preserving:
$$\mu_\alpha|_{K_\alpha \cap K_\beta} = \psi_{\alpha \beta}^* (\mu_\beta|_{K_\alpha \cap K_\beta}).$$
The pair $(\lambda, \mu)$ is called a \dfn{measured lamination}.
\end{definition}

One must be careful here: in \cite{thurston1979geometry}, it is assumed that $\supp \mu_\alpha = K_\alpha$, but in \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, it is only assumed that $\supp \mu_\alpha \subseteq K_\alpha$.
In particular, not every lamination admits a transverse measure:

\begin{example}
Let $\lambda$ be the pathological lamination of Example \ref{two geodesics}.
Let $\mu$ be transverse to $\lambda$, and let $F_\alpha$ be a flow box centered on a point of $\gamma_1$.
Then up to homeomorphism we may identify $K_\alpha$ with the one-point compactification of $\NN$, where $\infty$ corresponds to $\gamma_1$, and each of the natural numbers corresponds to a component of the intersection of $\gamma_2$ with the image of $F_\alpha$.
TODO: Make a picture.

The condition that $\mu_\alpha$ has full support implies that for each $n \in \NN$, $\mu_\alpha(\{n\}) > 0$, and the condition that $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$ is measure-preserving implies that $\mu_\alpha(\{n\})$ is independent of $n$, since $n, n + 1$ are both indices of the same leaf.
So any neighborhood of $\infty$ has infinite measure, which contradicts that $\mu_\alpha$ is a Radon measure on the compact set $K_\alpha$.
\end{example}

The definition of transverse measure in terms of Radon measures on $K_\alpha$ is convenient because $K_\alpha$ is compact, but it is not intrinsic, so we seek an equivalent condition.

\begin{definition}
A lamination is \dfn{oriented} if one can choose its transition maps to all be orientation-preserving.
\end{definition}

It is clear that a lamination $\lambda$ is locally orientable, since if one replaces $M$ by a small open set, then $\lambda$ has a global flow box.

\begin{definition}
Let $(\lambda, \mu)$ be a measured oriented lamination and let $(\chi_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}$ be a subordinate partition of unity.
The \dfn{Ruelle-Sullivan current} associated to $(\lambda, \mu)$ is defined for all compactly supported $d-1$-forms $\varphi$ by
\begin{equation}\label{RS current}
\int_M T_\mu \wedge \varphi := \sum_{\alpha \in A} \int_{K_\alpha} \left[\int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* (\chi_\alpha \varphi) \right] \dif \mu_\alpha(k).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
The Ruelle-Sullivan current $T_\mu$ is well-defined; it is honestly a $d-1$-current, and does not depend on the choice of partition of unity.
Moreover, $\dif T_\mu = 0$, and it is possible to reconstruct $\mu$ from $T_\mu$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The right-hand side of (\ref{RS current}) is always finite, because we can refine $(\chi_\alpha)$ to be subordinate to a locally finite open cover, and then the compact support of $\varphi$, the fact that $(F_\alpha^{-1})^* (\chi_\alpha \varphi)$ is Hodge dual to a $L^\infty_\cpt$ function on $\RR^{d - 1}$, and the fact that $\dif \mu_\alpha$ is a compactly supported Radon measure together imply that we are integrating an $L^\infty$ function against a Radon measure on a compact subset of $A \times [-1, 1] \times \RR^{d - 1}$.
For the reconstruction, just take $\varphi$ to be the Hodge dual of the (necessarily only $L^\infty$) conormal to the leaves of $\lambda$; by cutting off $\varphi$ to a suitable open set $U$ of leaves we obtain $\mu_\alpha(U)$.
The other stuff is just like in \cite[\S8.1]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
A sequence of measured laminations $(\lambda_i, \mu_i)$ converges in the \dfn{weak topology of measures} to a measure $(\lambda, \mu)$ if it is possible to cover $M$ by open sets $(U_\beta)$ so that in each $U_\beta$, $\lambda$ is orientable, $\lambda_i$ is eventually orientable, and we can choose orientations in $U_\beta$ and a subordinate partition of unity $(\chi_{\alpha \beta})$ in $U_\beta$ such that, if we choose $\lambda_i, \lambda$ to be cooriented in $U_\beta$, the local Ruelle-Sullivan currents $T_{\mu_i}^\beta$ converge to $T_\mu^\beta$ in the weak topology of measures.
\end{definition}

Concretely, this means that after replacing $M$ with an open set which is so small that we may coorient $\lambda_i, \lambda$, one has 
$$\lim_{i \to \infty} \int_M T_{\mu_i} \wedge \varphi = \int_M T_\mu \wedge \varphi$$
for every compactly supported $d-1$-form $\varphi$.

\begin{lemma}
If there exists a common atlas $(F_\alpha)$ of flow boxes for $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda$, and $\mu_i, \mu$ are transverse to $\lambda_i, \lambda$, then $(\lambda_i, \mu_i) \to (\lambda, \mu)$ in the weak topology of measures iff for every $\alpha \in A$, $\mu_{i\alpha} \to \mu_\alpha$ in the weak topology of measures.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since they have common flow boxes, we can realize a test function $f$ for $\dif \mu_\alpha$ by choosing $\star \varphi$ to be conormal to the leaves.
Or we can build a test form $\varphi$ by noticing that only the Hodge dual to the conormal part matters, and the conormal part is given by $f$.
\end{proof}

Here is another characterization of the weak topology of measures in terms of transverse curves and homotopies between them.

\begin{definition}
A (global) \dfn{back-to-labels map} for a lamination $\lambda$ is a map $\Pi: M \to [-1, 1]$ such that for some global flow box $F$ and every leaf $N$, if $N$ is the fiber of $k \in [-1, 1]$ with respect to $F$, then $\Pi|_N = k$.
\end{definition}

From the definition of a lamination it follows that we can cover $\supp \lambda$ by open sets in which back-to-labels maps are defined.
Thus we will speak of local back-to-labels maps.

\begin{definition}
A curve $\gamma: [-1, 1] \to M$ is \dfn{transverse} to a lamination $\lambda$ if for every local back-to-labels map $\Pi$ for $\lambda$, $\gamma^* \Pi: [-1, 1] \to [-1, 1]$ is a homeomorphism onto its image.
A \dfn{homotopy} between transverse curves is a homotopy between curves $(\gamma_t)$ which preserves $\lambda$, such that each curve $\gamma_t$ is transverse to $\lambda$.
\end{definition}

For a transverse curve $\gamma$ to a measured lamination $(\lambda, \mu)$, we get a measure $\gamma^* \mu$ on $[-1, 1]$, as follows.
We first cover $\supp \lambda$ by domains of back-to-labels maps $\Pi_\alpha$ and consider a subordinate partition of unity $(\chi_\alpha)$.
Thus we have homeomorphisms $\Phi_\alpha = (\gamma^* \Pi_\alpha)^{-1}$ from a closed subinterval of $[-1, 1]$ containing the support of a localization $\mu_\alpha$ of $\mu$ to $[-1, 1]$.
So $(\Phi_\alpha)_* \mu_\alpha$ is a Radon measure on $[-1, 1]$.
Using the partition of unity $(\chi_\alpha)$ we reconstruct the measures into a measure $\gamma^* \mu$ on $[-1, 1]$.
From \cite[\S7]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} we know that $\gamma^* \mu$ is determined by the homotopy class of $\gamma$.
TODO fill in the details here.

We say that a $1$-form $\psi$ is \dfn{coordinated} with a Lipschitz $\gamma$ at $t \in [-1, 1]$ if there are arbitrarily small $\varepsilon > 0$ such that, with $\chi_\varepsilon$ a cutoff to $B(\gamma(t), \varepsilon)$, 
$$\dashint_{\gamma \cap B(\gamma(t), \varepsilon)} (\psi, \gamma'(t)) \dif s \geq \frac{1}{2}.$$ 

\begin{lemma}
A locally injective Lipschitz curve $\gamma$ is transverse to a measured lamination $(\lambda, \mu)$ iff there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for every $t \in [-1, 1]$ for which $\gamma(t) \in \supp \lambda$, and every $d-1$-form $\varphi$ such that $\star \varphi$ is coordinated with $\gamma$ at $t$, and all sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$ depending on $\varphi$,
$$\dashint_{B(\gamma(t), \varepsilon)} T_\mu \wedge \varphi \geq \delta.$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We work in the domain of a single flow box $F$ with back-to-labels map $\Pi$, centered on $\gamma(t)$.
Then $\gamma$ is not transverse at $\gamma(t)$ iff $\gamma^* \Pi$ is not a homeomorphism near $t$, which happens (since $\gamma$ is locally injective at $t$) iff $\gamma$ crosses the leaf $N$ containing $\gamma(t)$ at infinitely many times $t_i \to t$.
That happens iff one can weight and smooth out $\star (\gamma')^\flat$ to get too much cancellation.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{measured implies transversality}
$(\lambda_i, \mu_i) \to (\lambda, \mu)$ in the weak topology of measures iff for every transverse curve $\gamma$ to $\lambda$, $\gamma$ is eventually transverse to $\lambda_i$, and $\gamma^* \mu_i \to \gamma^* \mu$ in the weak topology of measures.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The content of this proposition is that $\gamma$ is eventually transverse, since $\mu_{i\alpha} \to \mu_\alpha$ and homeomorphisms preserve the weak topology.
The previous lemma shows that weak convergence of the Ruelle-Sullivan currents preserves transversality, so $\gamma$ is eventually transverse to $\lambda_i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{measured implies Thurston}
Let $(\lambda_i, \mu_i)$ be measured geodesic laminations.
If $(\lambda_i, \mu_i) \to (\lambda, \mu)$ in the weak topology of measures, then $\lambda$ is a geodesic lamination and $\lambda_i \to \lambda$ in Thurston's geometric topology.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $N$ be a leaf of $\mu$ and $x \in N$.
We must first find $x_i \in \supp \lambda_i$ such that $x_i \to x$.
To accomplish this, for each $\varepsilon > 0$ choose an $d-1$-form $\varphi_\varepsilon$ in $L^\infty_\cpt(B(x, \varepsilon))$ such that for each leaf $\tilde N$ of $\lambda$ which meets $B(x, \varepsilon/2)$,
\begin{equation}\label{test form is conormal}
\int_{B(x, \varepsilon/2) \cap \tilde N} \varphi_\varepsilon \wedge \normal_{\tilde N} \geq 1,
\end{equation}
and choose a flow box $F_\alpha$ for $\lambda$ at $x$.
For any $\varepsilon$ small enough, $\lambda_i, \lambda$ are coorientable, so we can choose Ruelle-Sullivan currents $T_{\mu_i}, T_\mu$ defined on $B(x, \varepsilon)$ such that for $i$ large enough, 
\begin{align*}
\int_{B(x, \varepsilon)} T_{\mu_i} \wedge \varphi_\varepsilon
&\geq \frac{1}{2} \int_{B(x, \varepsilon)} T_\mu \wedge \varphi_\varepsilon\\
&\geq \frac{1}{2} \int_{K_\alpha} \left[\int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* (1_{B(x, \varepsilon/2)} \varphi_\varepsilon)\right] \dif \mu_\alpha(k).
\end{align*}
By (\ref{test form is conormal}), there exists $k_0 > 0$ such that for $|k| < k_0$ in $K_\alpha$,
$$\int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* (1_{B(x, \varepsilon/2)} \varphi_\varepsilon) \geq 1,$$
and since $\mu_\alpha$ is supported near $0$ in $K_\alpha$ it follows that $\int T_{\mu_i} \wedge \varphi_\varepsilon \gtrsim 1$.
Therefore there exists
$$x_i \in B(x, \varepsilon) \cap \supp T_{\mu_i} = B(x, \varepsilon) \cap \supp \lambda_i.$$
Since $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, we conclude $x_i \to x$.

We now claim that $N$ is a complete geodesic (so $\lambda$ is a geodesic lamination).
To see this, let $x \in N$ and $r > 0$ such that $B := B(x, r)$ satisfies $\pi_1(B) = 0$.
In $B$, we can write $T_{\mu_i} = \dif u_i$ for some sequence of functions of least gradient $u_i \in BV(B)$.
Since $u_i$ is only defined up to a constant, we impose $\int_M \star u_i = 0$, so by Poincar\'e's inequality,
$$||u_i||_{L^1(B)} \lesssim r\int_B \star |T_{\mu_i}| \lesssim 1$$
where the last bound is because $(T_{\mu_i})$ is compact in the weak topology of measures.
By the Miranda stability theorem, $(u_i)$ converges in $L^1$ along a subsequence to a function $u$ of least gradient in $B$.
If $\varphi$ is a compactly supported $d-1$-form in $B$ we have 
\begin{align*}
\int_B T_\mu \wedge \varphi
&= \lim_{i \to \infty} \int_B T_{\mu_i} \wedge \varphi 
= -\lim_{i \to \infty} \int_B u_i \dif \varphi = - \int_B u \dif \varphi
\end{align*}
where the last equality is because the Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative of $\dif \varphi$ with respect to Lebesgue measure is in $L^\infty$ and hence $L^1(\dif \varphi)$ is a weaker space than $L^1$.
It follows that $T_\mu = \dif u$, so by the theory of \cite{BackusFLG}, $N$ is a geodesic and $x$ is not an endpoint of $N$.
But $x$ is arbitrary, so $N$ is in fact complete.

It remains to show that $\normal_i := \normal_{N_i}(x_i)$ converges to $\normal := \normal_N(x)$ in the cosphere bundle $S'M$, possibly after choosing a different sequence of $x_i$ and $N_i$ such that $x_i \to x$.
If this fails, then we work in normal coordinates based at $x$, so we can think of points of $M$ as vectors in $\RR^d$, and points of $S'M$ as unit vectors in $\RR^d$.
In such coordinates we may view $N$ as the first axis.
We can then choose $\varepsilon > 0$ such that no matter what sequence $(x_i, N_i)$ we choose, for every $i$ large enough,
$$|\sin \angle(\normal_i, \normal)| \geq \varepsilon.$$
The geodesic curvature of $N_i$ with respect to the euclidean metric on the tangent space is bounded independently of $i$ in terms of the scalar curvature $R$ of $M$ near $x$, so there exists $r = r(R) > 0$ independent of $i$ such that $N_i$ \dfn{avoids cones} in the sense that for every $v \in \RR^d$ such that $0 < |v| < r$ and $|\sin v| < \varepsilon/2$, $v + x_i$ does not lie in $N_i$.
After shrinking $\varepsilon$, we may assume that $\varepsilon < \max(r/2, 1/100)$.

To obtain a contradiction, we choose $y$ to lie on $N$ and satisfy $\dist(x, y) = \varepsilon$.
For $i$ large, $|x_i| < \varepsilon^2/10$, so
$$0 < \varepsilon - \varepsilon^2 \leq |y - x_i| < 2\varepsilon = r$$
and hence (using a superscript $j$ to indicate the $j$th coordinate)
$$|y^1 - x_i^1| \geq |y - x_i| - |x_i^2| \geq \varepsilon - 2\varepsilon^2.$$
Consider the triangle $\Delta$ whose vertices are $x_i, y$, and $z_i := (y^1, x_i^2)$.
Then $\Delta$ is a right triangle, and its smallest angle $\theta_\Delta$ satisfies
$$|\sin \theta_\Delta| = \frac{|x_i^2|}{|y^1 - x_i^1|} < \frac{\varepsilon^2}{\varepsilon - 2\varepsilon^2} < \frac{\varepsilon}{4}.$$
Thus for every large $i$, $y$ is contained in the cone avoided by $N_i$, and in fact for any $y_i \in N_i$, $\dist(y, y_i) \geq \varepsilon/4$.
But we argued above that any point of $N$ could be approximated by points of $N_i$ for $i$ large, so this is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Convergence in flow boxes}
Let $C^{1-}$ be the Fr\'echet space $\bigcap_{\alpha < 1} C^\alpha$, where $C^\alpha$ are H\"older spaces.
The following definition is one possible interpretation of the vague definition of \cite[Lemma II.1.2]{ColdingMinicozziV}.

\begin{definition}
A sequence $(\lambda_i)$ of laminations \dfn{converges on the level of flow boxes} to $\lambda$ if it converges in Thurston's geometric topology, and we can find atlases
$$F_{i\alpha}: U_\alpha \to [-1, 1] \times \RR^{d - 1}$$
of flow boxes for $\lambda_i$, and an atlas $F_\alpha: U_\alpha \to [-1, 1] \times \RR^{d - 1}$ of flow boxes for $\lambda$, such that $F_{i\alpha} \to F_\alpha$ and $F_{i\alpha}^{-1} \to F_\alpha^{-1}$ in $C^{1-}$.
\end{definition}

Just as for Thurston's geometric topology, convergence on the level of flow boxes does not satisfy uniqueness of limits, and hence we speak of \dfn{maximal limits} to allow us to speak of a unique limit of a sequence.


\begin{theorem}
Let $(\lambda_i, \mu_i)$ be measured geodesic laminations.
If $(\lambda_i, \mu_i) \to (\lambda, \mu)$ in the weak topology of measures, then $\lambda_i \to \lambda$ on the level of flow boxes.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{measured implies Thurston}, $\lambda_i \to \lambda$ in Thurston's geometric topology and $\lambda$ is a geodesic lamination.
A transversal $\gamma$ to $\lambda$ induces a Lipschitz flow box $F$ to $\lambda$ as in \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
We also get flow boxes $F_i$ for $i$ large enough since eventually $\gamma$ is transverse to $\lambda_i$, by Proposition \ref{measured implies transversality}.
These are all uniformly Lipschitz and co-Lipschitz by Theorem \ref{regularity theorem}, so by Arzela-Ascoli every sequence has a further subsequence which converges to some $\tilde F$ in $C^{1-}$.
We then need to show that $\tilde F$ is the limit of $F_i$ and is a flow box for $\lambda$...
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The compactness theorem}
\begin{definition}
A sequence of laminations $(\lambda_i)$ is \dfn{tight} if ... a sequence of transverse measures is \dfn{tight}...
\end{definition}

It follows from the definitions that if $M$ is closed, then every sequence of laminations in $M$ is tight.
A sequence of measured laminations $(\lambda_i, \mu_i)$ in a closed manifold such that $(\mu_i)_\gamma([-1, 1]) \lesssim 1$ independently of $i$ or the homotopy class $\gamma$ is also tight.

\begin{theorem}
Let $(\lambda_i)$ be a tight sequence of minimal laminations with bounded curvature. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item After passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $(\lambda_i)$ converges to a maximal limit $\lambda$ on the level of flow boxes, and hence in Thurston's geometric topology.
\item The limit $\lambda$ is a Lipschitz minimal lamination satisfying the same curvature bounds as $(\lambda_i)$.
\item If $\mu_i$ is a transverse measure to $\lambda_i$ such that $(\mu_i)$ is tight, then after passing to a further subsequence, we may assume that $(\lambda_i, \mu_i)$ in fact converges to some measured minimal lamination $(\lambda, \mu)$ in the weak topology of measures.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By a density argument we may assume that $\lambda_i$ has finitely many leaves.
We now select $x_0 \in M$ and construct flow boxes $F_i$ on $B(x_0, r)$ where $r > 0$ is to be determined, but is at least smaller than the injectivity radius $R(x_0)$.

Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
After selecting $r$ small depending on $g$, $\varepsilon$, and $\sup_i ||\lambda_i||_{B(x_0, R(x_0))}$, and rescaling $g$, we may assume that the leaves $N_{i1}, \dots, N_{ik_i}$ have all second fundamental forms of size $\leq \varepsilon/2$ on $B(x_0, r)$.
Then if $r$ is small enough depending on $g$, the second fundamental forms with respect to the euclidean metric on $x_0$-normal coordinates are of size $\leq \varepsilon$ on $B(x_0, r)$.
Moreover, because there is a global Lipschitz normal vector field to $\lambda_i$, we can represent $N_{i1}, \dots, N_{ik_i}$ as graphs over the equatorial hyperplane in $B(x_0, r)$, possibly after applying a rotation $R_i$.
Thus we have coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$ on $B(x_0, r)$ where
$$N_{ij} = \{(y_i = f_{ij}(x_i))\}.$$
Somewhere in here we have to replace $B(x_0, r)$ with a cylinder, just like in the proof of de Giorgi's lemma.

By the maximum principle, the $f_{ij}$ satisfy $f_{ij}(x_i) = f_{ij'}(x_i)$ implies $j = j'$.
It follows that after applying a permutation to $\{1, \dots, k_i\}$ we may assume that $j < j'$ implies $f_{ij} < f_{ij'}$.
Then if we set $u_{ij} := f_{i,j+1} - f_{ij}$, then $u_{ij} > 0$ and we get a second-order operator $P_{ij}$ such that
$$\Delta u_{ij} = P_{ij} u_{ij}$$
and $||P_{ij}|| \lesssim \varepsilon$.
Then for $\delta > 0$, the Schauder and Harnack inequalities give
$$\delta r ||\dif u_{ij}||_{C^0(B_{\delta r})} \lesssim \sup_{B(\delta r)} u_{ij} \leq e^{c_1(\varepsilon) \delta^{c_2(\varepsilon)}} \inf_{B(\delta r)} u_{ij}.$$
We now set $\eta_{ij} := f_{ij}(0)$ and define for $\xi_i \in B_r$ and $\eta_i \in [\eta_{ij}, \eta_{i,j+1}]$
$$\varphi_i(\xi_i, \eta_i) := f_{ij}(\xi_i) + \frac{\eta_i - \eta_{ij}}{\eta_{i,j+1} - \eta_{ij}} f_{ij}(x_i).$$
That is, the change of coordinates
$$(x_i, y_i) = (\xi_i, \varphi_i(\xi_i, \eta_i))$$
flattens out the graphs of the $f_{ij}$ to hyperplanes.
Moreover
$$\dif \varphi_i = \dif f_{ij} + \frac{\eta_i - \eta_{ij}}{\eta_{i,j+1} - \eta_{ij}} \dif u_{ij} + \frac{u_{ij}}{\eta_{i,j+1} - \eta_{ij}} \dif \eta_i.$$
If we chose $R_i$ correctly, then $\dif f_{ij}$ is small, and if we chose $\varepsilon, \delta$ small enough then $\dif u_{ij}$ is small too.
Also we cooked up these coordinates so that $f_{ij} \approx \eta_{ij}$ on $B_{\delta r}$ if $\delta$ is small enough, thus the coefficient on the $\dif \eta_i$ is basically unity.
In particular $\dif \varphi_i \approx \dif \eta_i$ in $L^\infty$.

In conclusion, we can get a flow box $F_i$ by rotating the diffeomorphism $(x_i, y_i) = (\xi_i, \varphi_i(\xi_i, \eta_i))$ by $R_i$, and $F_i$ will have Lipschitz norm and conorm both very close to $1$.
So by a compactness argument we see that a subsequence converges in $C^{1-}$ to a flow box $F$.
The leaves are $C^{1-}$-limits of hypersurfaces with uniformly small second fundamental form so they are $C^{1-}$ as well.
But a $C^{1-}$ limit of minimal hypersurfaces is minimal, and also $C^\infty$.
Finally, Theorem \ref{regularity theorem} implies that we can upgrade from $C^{1-}$ regularity of $F$ to Lipschitz regularity.
The Prokohorov compactness theorem lets us upgrade it to convergence in the weak topology of measures.

TODO, That's very sketchy and there's a lot of details to fill in. But that's the idea.
\end{proof}

TODO: Can we upgrade this all the way to convergence in $BV$?
The converse holds anyways


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Construction of minimal laminations}
We conclude this paper by applying the above theory to prove a condition for a collection of minimal hypersurfaces to form a minimal lamination.
This condition will be used in the companion papers \cite{BackusFLG, DaskalopoulosPrep2}.

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{minimal partition} is a closed subset $\lambda$ of $M$ which has been partitioned into (disjoint, embedded, without boundary) minimal hypersurfaces, called the \dfn{leaves} of $\lambda$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $\lambda$ be a minimal partition such that the second fundamental forms of the leaves of $\lambda$ are locally uniformly bounded.
Then $\lambda$ is a minimal lamination.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $(x_i)$ be a dense sequence in $\supp \lambda$, and let $N_i$ be the leaf containing $x_i$.
Then the union of $N_1, \dots, N_i$ is the support of a lamination $\lambda_i$.
By assumption, $||\lambda_i||_K \lesssim_K 1$.
So $(\lambda_i)$ has a minimal subsequential limit $\tilde \lambda$ on the level of flow boxes.
TODO we have to use Thurston's geometric topology to show that $\tilde \lambda = \lambda$.
\end{proof}

The above result is particularly useful when it is combined with the stable Bernstein theorem.\footnote{so-called because this theorem is essentially equivalent to the assertion that a stable two-sided minimal hypersurface in $\RR^d$ is a hyperplane.}

\begin{proposition}[stable Bernstein theorem]
Let $2 \leq d \leq 4$ and let $N$ be a two-sided stable minimal hypersurface in $B_r \subseteq M$, $r \lesssim 1$, where $M$ has bounded geometry and dimension $d$.
Then on $B_{r/2}$, $|\Two_N| \lesssim_M r^{-1}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
If $d = 2$ this is trivial since $\Two_N$ has zero independent components and hence $\Two_N = 0$, if $d = 3$ then it was proven by Schoen \cite[Corollary 2.11]{colding2011course}, and if $d = 4$ it was proven by Chodosh--Li \cite{Chodosh2021}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Let $\lambda$ be a minimal partition in $M$ whose leaves are two-sided and stable, where $M$ has dimension $2 \leq d \leq 4$.
Then $\lambda$ is a minimal lamination.
\end{corollary}
