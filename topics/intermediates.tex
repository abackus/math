\begin{definition}
Let $S$ be a closed set.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A (codimension $1$ lamination) \dfn{flow box} for $S$ is a Lipschitz chart in which $S$ can be expressed as $K \times N \subseteq \RR^d$ for some closed $K \subseteq \RR$ and open connected $N \subseteq \RR^{d - 1}$.
\item A (codimension $1$) \dfn{lamination} $\lambda$ in $M$, with support $S$, consists of an atlas of lamination flow boxes whose transition maps preserve the local product structure.
\item A \dfn{leaf} of $\lambda$ is a connected subset of $\supp \lambda = S$ which is locally modeled on the fibers $\{k\} \times N$, $k \in K$.
\item The lamination $\lambda$ is \dfn{minimal} if every leaf of $\lambda$ is $C^2$ and has zero mean curvature.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

See \cite{Morgan88} for a detailed treatment of laminations.
Note carefully that the term ``minimal lamination'' is overloaded: in \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse,casson_bleiler_1988} it refers to laminations which are minimal with respect to inclusion, which has nothing to do with the condition on leaves.
In the surface case $d = 2$, minimal laminations are also called \dfn{geodesic laminations}, though we will not use this terminology.

\begin{definition}
Let $\lambda$ be a lamination, let $\psi_{ij}$, $i,j \in I$, be the transition maps for $\lambda$, and let $(\chi_i)$ be a partition of unity subordinate to $(\psi_{ij})$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\lambda$ is \dfn{measured} if it is equipped with Radon measures $\mu_i$ on each set of leaves $K_i$, $i \in I$, such that $\psi_{ij}^* \mu_i = \mu_j$; in that case we say that $\mu = (\mu_i)$ is a \dfn{transverse measure} to $\lambda$.
\item $\lambda$ is \dfn{oriented} if $\psi_{ij}$ are oriented.
\item If $\lambda$ is a measured oriented lamination, then the \dfn{Ruelle-Sullivan current} $T_\lambda$ of $\lambda$ satisfies, for every $d-1$-form $\varphi$,
$$\int_M T_\lambda \wedge \varphi := \sum_{i \in I} \int_{K_i} \int_{\{k\} \times N_i} \chi_i \varphi \dif \mu_i(k).$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Of course, the choice of partition of unity $(\chi_i)$ in the definition of Ruelle-Sullivan current is immaterial.
The Ruelle-Sullivan current is always closed, $\dif T_\lambda = 0$, so it can be locally written $T_\lambda = \dif u$.
The main theorem of this paper characterizes the functions $u$ for which $\dif u$ is a Ruelle-Sullivan current for a minimal lamination:

\begin{mainthm}\label{main thm}
Let $2 \leq d \leq 4$ and suppose that $M$ has constant sectional curvature.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $u$ be a function of least gradient.
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item for every $y \in \RR$, $\partial \{u > y\}$ is either empty or an analytic embedded hypersurface,
\item $\bigcup_{y \in \RR} \partial \{u > y\}$ is the support of a minimal measured oriented lamination $\lambda$ whose leaves are the connected components of the hypersurfaces $\partial \{u > y\}$, and
\item the Ruelle-Sullivan current of $\lambda$ is $\dif u$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Conversely, if $\lambda$ is a minimal measured oriented lamination and $\dif u$ is the Ruelle-Sullivan current of $\lambda$, then $u$ has least gradient.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mainthm}

The r\^ole of the hypothesis $d \leq 4$ is to ensure that the stable Bernstein theorem \cite{Chodosh2021} holds, which ensures that the level sets actually form a lamination.
One can show that the level sets are analytic with the weaker hypothesis $d \leq 7$, and so this result would hold for $d \leq 7$ if we knew a stable Bernstein theorem in that setting.

Moreover, one can remove the assumption that $\dif u$ is exact in the converse statement; a priori, one only knows that the Ruelle-Sullivan current is closed.
Recall that an affine line bundle is \dfn{flat with structure group} $\RR$ if it is equipped with a cover by local trivializations so that the transition maps $\psi_{ij}$ satisfy $\psi_{ij}(v) = v + c_{ij}$ for some constants $c_{ij} \in \RR$.
These transition maps preserve the least-gradient functional so we may discuss sections of such bundles which have locally least gradient.
Any closed current defines such a bundle, as we discuss in \S\ref{LamPrelim}, and one can find a primitive of $\dif u$ in that bundle which has locally least gradient.

Theorem \ref{main thm} was proven by Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck in the special case that $M$ is a hyperbolic surface and $u$ is dual to an $\infty$-harmonic function \cite[Theorem 5.2, Theorem 6.10]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
In that same paper, Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck conjectured that Theorem \ref{main thm} should hold for $M$ a hyperbolic surface, with no duality assumption \cite[Problem 9.4, Conjecture 9.5]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.


\subsection{Regularity for the one-Laplacian}
Theorem \ref{main thm} strengthens the result of \cite{Mazon14} which gives an Euler-Lagrange characterization of functions of least gradient.
That paper characterized the $1$-harmonic functions in terms of a measurable vector field; we replace this vector field with a Lipschitz vector field.

\begin{corollary}
Let $2 \leq d \leq 4$, suppose that $M$ has constant sectional curvature, and let $u \in BV_\loc(M)$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $u$ has least gradient.
\item There exists a vector field $X \in L^\infty(\star |\dif u|)$ such that $(\dif u, X) = |\dif u|$ and $\Div X = 0$.
\item There exists a locally Lipschitz vector field $X$ such that $(\dif u, X) = |\dif u|$ and $\Div X = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By \cite{Mazon14}, the first two conditions are equivalent. TODO: They use existence of the $p$-harmonics to prove this, need to check this for arbitrary manifolds.
Moreover, it is clear that if the last condition holds, then so do the other two.

Finally, if $u$ has least gradient, then Theorem \ref{main thm} we may select oriented Lipschitz coordinates $(x, y) \in \RR^{d - 1} \times \RR$ so that $u(x, y)$ depends on $y$ alone.
Then $\dif y$ is a Lipschitz $1$-form which is conormal to the level sets of $u$, and by gluing together local coordinate patches using a partition of unity and the orientation we may find a Lipschitz conormal $1$-form to the level sets.
Since $\dif u$ is also conormal to the level sets, and the conormal bundle is a line bundle,
$$g^{-1}(\dif y, \dif u) = |\dif y| \cdot |\dif u|.$$
Then $X := ((\dif y)/|\dif y|)^\sharp$ is as desired.
\end{proof}

As a byproduct of the proof of Theorem \ref{main thm}, we also obtain a generalization of G\'orny's regularity theorem \cite[Theorem 1.2]{g√≥rny2017planar} for functions of least gradient.
If $E$ is a flat affine line bundle with structure group $\RR$, we write $-E$ for the affine line bundle with transition functions $x \mapsto x - c_{ij}$ where $E$ has transition functions $x \mapsto x + c_{ij}$.

\begin{mainthm}\label{Gorny regularity}
Let $2 \leq d \leq 7$, suppose that $M$ has constant sectional curvature, and let $u: M \to \RR$ have least gradient.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every $x \in M$, either $u$ is continuous at $x$ or $u$ has a jump discontinuity along an analytic minimal hypersurface containing $x$, and
\item there exists a flat affine line bundle $E \to M$ with structure group $\RR$ and sections $u_{\text{jmp}}: M \to E$, $u_{\text{cts}}: M \to -E$ of locally least gradient, such that $u_{\text{jmp}}$ has a jump-type derivative, $u_{\text{cts}}$ is continuous, and $u = u_{\text{jmp}} + u_{\text{cts}}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mainthm}

This regularity result shows that functions of least gradient are significantly better behaved than general $BV_\loc$ functions.
For example, the function $u(z) = z^{1/2}$ on $\CC$ (with the standard branch) does not admit such a decomposition near $0$ \cite[Example 4.1]{Ambrosio2000FunctionsOB}.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Application to minimal laminations}\label{GornySec}
\subsection{Topological preliminaries} \label{LamPrelim}
In this section we prove our main Theorems \ref{main thm} and \ref{Gorny regularity}, somewhat simultaneously.
Throughout, we fix an oriented manifold $M$ of constant sectional curvature and dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$.

We have a Liouville theorem in the sense that there are no global functions of least gradient on a closed hyperbolic manifold except constants.
However, the least-gradient functional is preserved by addition of constants, so we can talk about sections of flat affine line bundles with structure group $\RR = (\RR, +)$ which are locally functions of least gradient.
This approach is also taken by \cite[\S2.1]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, which identify such bundles with representations of $\pi_1(M)$, as follows:

\begin{definition}
Let $\alpha: \pi_1(M) \to \RR$ be a representation and let $\tilde M \to M$ be the universal cover.
The \dfn{twisted product} $M \times_\alpha \RR$ is the affine line bundle whose sections are canonically identified with functions $\tilde f: \tilde M \to \RR$ such that for $\gamma \in \pi_1(M)$ and $\tilde x \in \tilde M$,
$$\tilde f(\gamma \tilde x) = \tilde f(\tilde x) + \alpha(\gamma).$$
\end{definition}

It follows that $M \times_\alpha \RR$ is flat, with structure group $\RR$.
This construction is primarily useful when $\tilde M$ is not compact, as then the maximum principle does not obstruct the existence of nontrivial solutions of elliptic PDE on $\tilde M$.
For example it applies to any complete hyperbolic manifold $M = \Hyp^d/\pi_1(M)$.

By \cite{Ruelle75}, a Ruelle-Sullivan current $T_\mu$ is a closed $d-1$-current, which is well-defined in that it does not depend on the choice of partition of unity, and hence defines a cohomology class in $H^1(M, \RR)$. So by the Hurecwiz theorem, we obtain a representation $\alpha: \pi_1(M) \to \RR$.
The construction of \cite[Theorem 8.3]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} shows that there is a section $u \in BV_\loc(M, M \times_\alpha \RR)$ such that $\dif u = T_\mu$.

TODO: Do I care about orientation bundles?

TODO: Exposit and clean this up

\begin{proposition}\label{existence of jump graphs}
Let $u \in BV(M)$ be not essentially discontinuous.
Assume that $J_u$ is an embedded hypersurface and the traces of $u$ along each component $N$ of $J_u$ are constant on each side of $N$.
Then there exists an affine line bundle $E \to M$, which is flat with structure group $\RR$, and a section $Ju: M \to E$ such that $Ju$ is locally constant on $M \setminus \lambda$ and for each leaf $N$ of $\lambda$, the amounts that $u, Ju$ jump along $N$ are equal.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We first observe that $\pi_0(M \setminus \lambda)$ is nonempty and countable, since $\lambda$ is a countable union of null sets and so $M \setminus \lambda$ is nonempty, and since $\lambda$ only has countably many connected components.
We define a new lamination $\tilde \lambda$, as follows. Initialize $\tilde \lambda := \lambda$ and replace each leaf in $\lambda$ with its connected components.
We then adjoin further leaves to $\tilde \lambda$ so that for each $U \in \pi_0(M \setminus \tilde \lambda)$, if $\mathcal V(U)$ denotes the set of components which are adjacent to $U$, then $\overline{U \cup \bigcup_{V \in \mathcal V(U)} V}$ is contained in a simply connected subset of $M$.

We set $\{U_i: i \in I\} = \pi_0(M \setminus \tilde \lambda)$ for a countable set $I$.
We endow $I$ with the structure of a weighted directed multigraph, where the set of edges $E_{ij}$ from $i$ to $j$ is $E_{ij} := \pi_0(\partial U_i \cap \partial U_j)$ if $i \neq j$.
Thus each element of $E_{ij}$ is a leaf of $\tilde \lambda$.
We weight an edge $N \in E_{ij}$ by the amount that $u$ jumps along any curve $\gamma$ from $U_i$ to $U_j$ transverse to $N$ when $\gamma$ passes through $N$.
The leaves we adjoined all have weight $0$.

We choose $x_i \in U_i$ for each $i \in I$.
We call a path $\sum_k N_k$ through $I$, where $N_k$ is an edge $i_k \to j_k$, a \dfn{boundary} if there are curves $\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_m$, where $\gamma_k$ is a curve $x_{i_k} \to x_{j_k}$ that is transverse to $\tilde \lambda$ and passes through $N_k$ exactly once, and the homology class $[\sum_k \gamma_k]$ is zero.
We call a path a \dfn{cycle} if its total weight is $0$, and two paths \dfn{homologous} if their difference is a boundary.

\begin{claim}
Every boundary is a cycle.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}[Proof of claim]
Let $k = 1, \dots, n$, let $\gamma := \sum_k \gamma_k$ be the associated $1$-chain to a boundary $\sum_k N_k$, and let $w_k$ be the weight of $N_k$.
If we set $v$ to be $u$ on $U_{i_1}$, $u - w_1$ on $U_{i_2}$, etc., $u - \sum_{k < n} w_k$ on $U_{i_n}$, then $v$ is continuous away from $N_{i_n}$ where it has a jump discontinuity of size $\sum_k w_k$.
Then $\int_\gamma \dif v = 0$ but also $\int_\gamma \dif v = \sum_k w_k$.
\end{proof}

Let $P_{ij}$ be the set of paths $i \to j$, thus if $p, q \in P_{ij}$ are homologous, then $p - q$ is a cycle.
On the other hand, if $i, j$ are adjacent, then for $N, N' \in E_{ij}$ and $\gamma, \gamma': x_i \to x_j$ which are respectively transverse to $N, N'$ and do not leave $\overline U_i \cup \overline U_j$, $[\gamma - \gamma'] = 0$, so $N, N'$ are homologous and hence $N - N'$ is a cycle.

We now define $V_i$ to be the interior of $\overline U_i \cup \bigcup_{E_{ij} \neq \emptyset} \overline U_j$.
Then $(V_i)$ is an open cover of $M$.
For $x \in V_i \setminus \tilde \lambda$, let $j(x)$ be such that $x \in U_{j(x)}$, and let $Ju_i(x)$ be the weight of some (and hence any) edge in $E_{ij(x)}$ if $j(x) \neq i$, or $Ju_i(x) = 0$ if $j(x) = i$.
Then $Ju_i$ is well-defined, locally constant, and jumps by the same amount along each leaf of $\tilde \lambda$ in $V_i$ as $u$.
Moreover, on $V_i \cap V_j$, $Ju_i - Ju_j = Ju_i(x_j)$ which is constant.
Now the desired bundle $E$ exists with flat trivializations $V_i$ and transition functions $s_{ij} := Ju_i(x_j)$.
If $V_i \cap V_j \cap V_k$ is nonempty, then it is contained in a simply connected set and so $s_{ik} = s_{ij} + s_{jk}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Regularity of functions of least gradient}
In order to apply Proposition \ref{construction of minimal partitions}, it will be convenient to reduce to the cases that a given function $u$ of least gradient is either continuous, or the jump function of a lamination whose moduli space of leaves is discrete.
This will be possible if we prove Theorem \ref{Gorny regularity}, and thanks to Proposition \ref{construction of minimal partitions} this can be done.

\begin{lemma}
Let $u$ be a function of least gradient and $x \in M$. Then either the germ of $u$ at $x$ is continuous, or there exists a level set $N$ of $u$ such that $x \in N$ and the traces of $u$ along $N$ are constant and nonequal.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Reasoning identically to the proof of \cite[Proposition 3.9]{g√≥rny2017planar} (TODO Clarify this point) we see that $u$ jumps at $x$ iff
$$\inf\left\{t \in \RR: \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{|\{u \leq t\} \cap B(x, r)|}{|B(x, r)|} = 1\right\} \neq \sup\left\{t \in \RR: \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{|\{u \geq t\} \cap B(x, r)|}{|B(x, r)|} = 1\right\}.$$
The claim now follows from \cite[Theorem 4.1]{HakkarainenKorteLahtiShanmugalingam+2015}, which is true for functions of least gradient on metric measure spaces and in particular holds in our setting.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{Gorny regularity}]
Let $u$ be a function of least gradient on $M$ with jump set $J_u$.
Combining the above propositions TODO, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) decomposition $u = u_j - u_c$ into sections $u_j, u_c: M \to E$, where $E$ is a flat affine line bundle with structure group $\RR$, such that $u_j$ is locally constant on $M \setminus \lambda$, $u_j$ has the same jumpset, with the same traces on each leaf, as $u$, and $u_c$ has no jump discontinuties.
Reasoning identically to \cite[pg11]{g√≥rny2017planar} we see that $u_j, u_c$ have locally least gradient.
Repeating the reasoning from the start of this proof and using the fact that $u_c$ has no jump discontinuities, it follows that $u_c$ is continuous.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Functions of least gradient induce minimal laminations}

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{minimal partition} is a closed set $\lambda$ which has been partitioned into (disjoint, embedded, without boundary) minimal hypersurfaces, called the \dfn{leaves} of $\lambda$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{construction of minimal partitions}
Let $u$ be a set of least gradient on $M$, $2 \leq d \leq 7$.
Then the connected components of the level sets $\partial \{u > y\}$ of $u$ define a minimal partition with support $\supp \dif u$, and each level set only has locally finitely many connected components, each of which is stable.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\mathscr P$ be the set of all connected components of all level sets of $u$.
By \cite[Theorem 1]{BOMBIERI1969}, for every $y \in \RR$, $\{u > y\}$ has least perimeter.
The argument of \cite{BOMBIERI1969} only relies on the coarea formula and Miranda stability theorem, which we proved for manifolds in \S\ref{Prelims}, so it applies in our setting.
So by Theorem \ref{main thm}, $\{u > y\}$ is bounded by connected, embedded, stable minimal hypersurfaces; in particular, the elements of $\mathscr P$ are connected, embedded, stable minimal hypersurfaces.
Moreover, the decomposition of $\partial \{u > y\}$ into components is locally finite.
Indeed, by Corollary \ref{doubling dimension}, each connected component $N$ of $\partial \{u > y\}$ satisfies $|N \cap B| \gtrsim r^{d - 1}$, yet $\partial \{u > y\}$ has locally finite perimeter, thus $|\partial \{u > y\} \cap B| < \infty$.

We now show that any two distinct $N_1, N_2 \in \mathscr P$ are disjoint.
If $x \in N_1 \cap N_2$, then let $N_i$ be a component of $\partial \{u > y_i\}$.
Without loss of generality, $y_1 \leq y_2$, thus $\{u > y_2\} \subseteq \{u > y_1\}$, and hence $N_2 \subseteq \overline{\{u > y_1\}}$.
In particular $N_2$ lies on one side of $N_1$, so by the maximum principle, the germs of $N_1$ and $N_2$ at $x$ are identical.
So by unique continuation, $N_1 = N_2$.

The following statements are manifestly equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x \notin \supp \dif u$.
\item The germ of $u$ at $x$ is constant.
\item If $u > y$ on one side of some hypersurface that passes through $x$, then $u > y$ near $x$.
\item $x \notin \partial \{u > y\}$ for any $y$.
\item $x \notin N$ for any leaf $N$ associated to $u$.
\end{enumerate}
It follows that $\supp \dif u$ is the support of the minimal partition whose set of leaves is $\mathscr P$.
\end{proof}

It is instructive to observe that the seemingly purely set-theoretic claims of the previous proposition require Theorem \ref{main lma}.
Indeed, in case $d = 8$, we could define for $x \in \RR^4$, $y \in \RR^3$, $z \in \RR$,
$$u(x, y, z) = \begin{cases}
-1, & z < 0 \\
0, & z > 0, |x|^2 < |y|^2 + z^2 \\
1, & z > 0, |x|^2 > |y|^2 + z^2
\end{cases}$$
and then the level sets of $u$ are the Simons cone $\{|x|^2 = |y|^2 + z^2\} \cap \{z \geq 0\}$ and the hyperplane $\{z = 0\}$, which intersect at $0$ and are minimal, thus $u$ has least gradient on $\RR^8$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{main thm}]
Let $u$ be a function of least gradient.
By Proposition \ref{construction of minimal partitions}, $\supp \dif u$ is the support of a minimal partition $\lambda$ whose leaves are the level sets of $u$, where each level set is the locally finite union of its components, and so by \cite[TODO]{BackusCML} $\lambda$ is a minimal lamination.

Let $(y_i, x_i): U_i \to Y_i \times N_i$, $i \in I$, be an atlas for $\lambda$.
Here $K_i \subseteq Y_i$ is the moduli space of leaves of $\lambda$ in $Y_i$.
Then, on the fibers $N_{y_i} := \{y_i\} \times N_i$, $u$ is constant.
Indeed, either $y_i \in K_i$ and so $N_{y_i}$ is contained in a level set of $u$, or $y_i \notin K_i$, so $N_{y_i}$ lies in a \dfn{plaque}, or component of $M \setminus \supp \lambda$, and hence $\dif u = 0$ in an open neighborhood of $N_{y_i}$.

In particular, we can define $u_i: Y_i \to \RR$ by setting $u_i(y_i) = u(y_i, x_i)$ for any $x_i \in N_i$.
Then $u_i$ satisfies the maximum principle: there do not exist $y_{i,1}$ and $y_{i,2}$ such that $u_i'(y_{i,1}) > 0$ and $u_i'(y_{i,2}) < 0$.
If there do, then we can replace $u$ with a competitor $\tilde u$ on $U_i$ by setting $\tilde u$ to be $u$ away from the region $\{y_{i,1} < y_i < y_{i,2}\}$ and to be constant on that region; then $\int_{U_i} \star |\dif \tilde u| < \int_{U_i} \star |\dif u|$ which contradicts that $u$ has least gradient.
So $u_i$ is either nondecreasing or nonincreasing on $Y_i$; if it is nonincreasing, we replace $y_i$ with $-y_i$.
With this convention, for any partition of unity $(\chi_i)$,
$$\normal^\sharp := \sum_{i \in I} \chi_i \frac{\grad y_i}{|\grad y_i|}$$
is a global section of the sphere bundle $SM$ which is normal to every leaf of $\lambda$. In particular, $\normal^\sharp$ defines an orientation $[\normal^\sharp]$ of $\lambda$.

We now define a transverse measure $\mu$ to $\lambda$.
First, by the G\'orny decomposition, there exist sections $u_j, u_c$ of locally least gradient such that $u_j$ is a jump section, $u_c$ is continuous, and $u = u_c + u_j$.
Then these define minimal laminations $\lambda_j, \lambda_c$.
Moreover, $\lambda_j$ is a \emph{discrete} lamination in that its moduli space of leaves $K_{j,i}$ in $U_i$ is a discrete set, so we can define an atomic measure $\mu_{j,i}(\{N\})$ to be the amount that $u_j$ jumps along $N$.
It is clear that the transition maps $\psi_{ik}$, $i,k \in I$, are measure-preserving.

As for the continuous part, we define a new (possibly non-Lipschitz) flow box coordinate $\tilde y_i$ by setting $\tilde y_i$ to equal $u_{c,i}$ on each leaf, and extend to the plaques by imposing that $\tilde y_i$ must be strictly increasing in $y_i$, and linear in $y_i$ on each plaque.
Then $y_i \mapsto \tilde y_i$ is a homeomorphism $Y_i \to \tilde Y_i$ for some $\tilde Y_i \subseteq \RR$, since $u_{c,i}$ is continuous and nondecreasing in $y_i$.
Here we are assuming that each flow box $U_i$ is contained in a trivialization of the affine line bundle of which $u_c$ is a section.
In particular, we may define for each Borel set $E \subset \tilde Y_i$,
$$\mu_{c,i}(E) := (\tilde y_i)_*(\star |\dif u|)(E) = \int_{(\tilde y_i)^*(E)} \star |\dif u|.$$
To see that $\psi_{ik}$ is measure-preserving we observe that $\psi_{ik}$ transforms $\tilde y_i$ to $\tilde y_k$, hence
$$\psi_{ik}^* \mu_{c,i} = \psi_{ik}^* (\tilde y_i)_* (\star |\dif u|) = (\tilde y_k)_* (\star |\dif u|) = \mu_{c,k}.$$

Summing up, $\mu_c, \mu_j$ are transverse measures and so their sum $\mu := \mu_c + \mu_j$ is also transverse.
By the disintegration theorem, for any $f \in L^1(\dif u)$,
$$\int_M f \star |\dif u| = \sum_{i \in I} \int_{K_i} \left[\int_{\{y_i\} \times N_i} \star_{y_i} \chi_i f \right] \dif \mu_i(y_i).$$
Here $\star_{y_i}$ is the Hodge star on $\{y_i\} \times N_i$ induced by $g$.
So for any $d-1$-form $\varphi$,
\begin{align*}
\int_M \dif u \wedge \varphi &= \int_M (\normal^\sharp, \varphi) \star |\dif u|
= \sum_{i \in I} \int_{K_i} \left[\int_{\{y_i\} \times N_i} \star_{y_i} \chi_i \star_{y_i} \varphi \dif \nu_{y_i}\right] \dif \mu_i(y_i) \\
&= \sum_{i \in I} \int_{K_i} \left[\int_{\{y_i\} \times N_i} \chi_i \varphi\right] \dif \mu_i(y_i)
\end{align*}
which implies that $\dif u$ is the Ruelle-Sullivan current of $(\lambda, [\normal^\sharp], \mu)$.

As for the converse, let $\lambda$ be a minimal lamination, and suppose that $\dif u$ is Ruelle-Sullivan for $\lambda$.
Then $\star |\dif u|$ is transverse to the leaves of $\lambda$, so $u$ is constant on each leaf.
Now let $U \Subset M$ and let $v \in BV_\cpt(U)$, thus $V = U \setminus \supp v$ is the intersection of an open neighborhood of $\partial U$ with $U$.
If $v$ is not identically zero, then there is a positive measure set $Y \subseteq \RR$ such that for $y \in Y$, $\partial \{u > y\} \neq \partial^* \{u + v > y\}$.
But
$$V \cap \partial \{u > y\} = V \cap \partial^* \{u + v > y\}$$
so $1_{\{u > y\}}$ and $1_{\{u + v > y\}}$ are equalized by the trace map $BV_\loc(U) \to L^1_\loc(\partial U)$.
Now $\{u > y\}$ has least perimeter in $U$, so if $|U \cap \partial \{u > y\}| = |U \cap \partial^* \{u + v > y\}|$ then $\{u + v > y\}$ has least perimeter in $U$.
Each component of $\partial \{u > y\}$ and $\partial \{u + v > y\}$ is a minimal hypersurface in $U$ with the same trace, so by unique continuation,
$$\partial \{u > y\} = \partial \{u + v > y\}.$$
But this contradicts the assumption that $y \in Y$. So for each $y \in Y$,
$$|U \cap \partial \{u > y\}| < |U \cap \partial^* \{u + v > y\}|.$$
Integrating both sides in $y$ using the coarea formula, we conclude that
\begin{align*}
\int_U \star |\dif u + \dif v| - \star |\dif u| &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty |U \cap \partial^* \{u + v > y\}| - |U \cap \partial \{u > y\}| \dif y \\
&= \int_Y |U \cap \partial^* \{u + v > y\}| - |U \cap \partial \{u > y\}| \dif y > 0,
\end{align*}
and since $v$ was an arbitrary perturbation, $u$ must have least gradient.
\end{proof}
