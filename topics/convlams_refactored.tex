\section{Introduction}
The space of codimension-$1$ minimal laminations on a Riemannian manifold has been topologized in several different ways.
Thurston \cite[Chapter 8]{thurston1979geometry} introduced both his geometric topology as well as the weak topology of measures on the space of measured geodesic laminations.
Independently of Thurston, Colding--Minicozzi \cite[Appendix B]{ColdingMinicozziIV} introduced a topology that emphasized not the laminations themselves, but rather the coordinate charts which flatten them.
We shall explain how these three modes of convergence are related, as well as the regularity and compactness theorems associated to each such mode.

We then turn to the main goal of this series of papers, which also includes the prequel paper \cite{BackusFLG}.
We show that any $1$-harmonic function gives rise to a Ruelle-Sullivan current for a minimal lamination, and conversely.
This generalizes a theorem of Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck \cite[Theorem 6.1]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} and resolves the outstanding problems \cite[Problem 9.4]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} and \cite[Conjecture 9.5]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Minimal laminations}\label{Lams sections}
Let $I \subset \RR$ be an interval, $J \subset \RR^{d - 1}$ a box, and $M$ a Riemannian manifold of dimension $d \geq 2$.
A (codimension-$1$) \dfn{laminar flow box} is a $C^0$ coordinate chart $F: I \times J \to M$ and a compact set $K \subseteq I$ such that each \dfn{leaf} $F(\{k\} \times J)$ is a $C^2$ complete hypersurface of the image of $F$.

Now let $(F_\alpha, K_\alpha)$ and $(F_\beta, K_\beta)$ be laminar flow boxes.
We say that they belong to the same \dfn{laminar atlas} if the transition map $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$ between $F_\alpha$ and $F_\beta$ maps each leaf $\{k\} \times J$, $k \in K_\alpha$, to a leaf $\{\psi_{\alpha \beta}(k)\} \times J$, so that $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$ is a homeomorphism $K_\alpha \to K_\beta$.

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{lamination} $\lambda$ consists of a nonempty closed set $S \subseteq M$, called its \dfn{support}, and a maximal laminar atlas $\{(F_\alpha, K_\alpha): \alpha \in A\}$ such that in the image $U_\alpha$ of each flow box $F_\alpha$,
$$S \cap U_\alpha = F_\alpha(K_\alpha \times J).$$
If $\lambda$ is a lamination in the image of a flow box $F$, and $N := F(\{k\} \times J)$ is a leaf of $\lambda$, we call $k$ the \dfn{label} of $N$.
\end{definition}

Summarizing the above definitions, a lamination is a nonempty closed set $S$ with a $C^0$ local product structure which realizes it as $K \times J$ for some compact set $K \subset \RR$.

We assume that the leaves of a lamination $\lambda$ are $C^2$ in order to ensure that the second fundamental form and mean curvature of each leaf is well-defined.
Such laminations are sometimes called $C^2$ \dfn{along leaves} \cite{Morgan88}.
A related notion, which we shall find useful, is that a lamination $\lambda$ is \dfn{tangentially} $C^r$, in the sense that the flow boxes $F_\alpha$ restrict to $C^r$ embeddings along each leaf $\{k\} \times J$, $k \in K_\alpha$.
In any case, we will make more precise assertions about regularity in \S\ref{Regularity}.

In this paper we shall focus on laminations with minimal leaves.\footnote{Caveat lector: The word ``minimal'' is overloaded. In \cite{casson_bleiler_1988,daskalopoulos2020transverse}, a \dfn{minimal lamination} is a lamination $\lambda$ in which every leaf is dense in $\supp \lambda$.
We adopt the terminology of \cite{Ohshika90}, which unfortunately clashes with the rest of the literature.}

\begin{definition}
A lamination $\lambda$ is \dfn{minimal} if its leaves $F_\alpha(\{k\} \times J)$ have zero mean curvature, and is \dfn{geodesic} if, in addition, $d = 2$.
\end{definition}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Spaces of minimal laminations}\label{LamSpace section}
Let $M$ be a manifold of constant sectional curvature and dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$.
In the literature, there are at least three different topologies on the space of laminations on $M$, which we now recall.

Thurston's geometric topology \cite[Chapter 8]{thurston1979geometry} says that a lamination $\lambda'$ is close to a lamination $\lambda$ if every leaf of $\lambda$ is close to a leaf of $\lambda'$ at least locally, and the same holds for their normal vectors $\normal$.

\begin{definition}
A sequence of laminations $(\lambda_i)$ converges to a lamination $\lambda$ in \dfn{Thurston's geometric topology} if, for every leaf $N$ of $\lambda$, every $x \in N$, and every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $i_\varepsilon \in \NN$ such that for every $i \geq i_\varepsilon$, $\supp \lambda_i$ intersects $B(x, \varepsilon)$, and for $x_i \in B(x, \varepsilon) \cap \supp \lambda_i$,
$$\dist_{SM}(\normal_{\lambda_i}(x_i), \normal_\lambda(x)) < 2\varepsilon.$$
\end{definition}

It is straightforward to show that Thurston's geometric topology does not depend on the choice of Riemannian metric on $M$, or the choice of extension of the distance function on $M$ to its sphere bundle $SM$, which are implicit in the statement thereof.
However, the limiting lamination is not unique, as if $\lambda_i \to \lambda$ and $\lambda'$ is a sublamination of $\lambda$, then $\lambda_i \to \lambda'$.
In particular, Thurston's topology is not Hausdorff, and we say that $\lambda$ is a \dfn{maximal limit} of a sequence $(\lambda_i)$ if $\lambda_i \to \lambda$ and for every $\lambda'$ such that $\lambda_i \to \lambda'$, $\lambda'$ is a sublamination of $\lambda$.

Independently of Thurston, Colding--Minicozzi \cite[Appendix B]{ColdingMinicozziIV} defined a sequence of laminations to converge ``if the corresponding coordinate maps converge;'' that is, if the laminar atlases converge.
This of course says nothing about the limiting set of leaves and in the sequel paper \cite{ColdingMinicozziV} they additionally impose that the sets of leaves converge ``as sets.''

In this paper we consider a similar condition to the one in \cite{ColdingMinicozziV}, which we believe to be more natural: that the laminar atlases converge and that the laminations themselves converge in Thurston's geometric topology.
To be more precise:

\begin{definition}
A sequence $(\lambda_i)$ of laminations \dfn{flow-box converges} in a function space $X$ to $\lambda$ if it converges in Thurston's geometric topology, and there exists a laminar atlas $(F_\alpha)$ for $\lambda$ such that for each $\alpha$, $F_\alpha$ and $(F_\alpha)^{-1}$ are limits in $X$ of flow boxes $F_\alpha^i$, $(F_\alpha^i)^{-1}$ in laminar atlases for $\lambda_i$.
\end{definition}

The notion of flow-box convergence is mainly useful in the case that $X = C^{1-} := \bigcup_{0 \leq \alpha < 1} C^\alpha$, where $C^\alpha$ are H\"older spaces.

We now define convergence of laminations equipped with transverse measures.

\begin{definition}
Let $\lambda$ be a lamination with atlas $A$.
A \dfn{transverse measure} to $\lambda$ consists of Radon measures $\mu_\alpha$ with $\supp \mu_\alpha = K_\alpha$, $\alpha \in A$, such that each transition map $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$ is measure-preserving:
$$\mu_\alpha|_{K_\alpha \cap K_\beta} = \psi_{\alpha \beta}^* (\mu_\beta|_{K_\alpha \cap K_\beta}).$$
The pair $(\lambda, \mu)$ is called a \dfn{measured lamination}.
\end{definition}

Caveat lector: we assume that $\supp \mu_\alpha = K_\alpha$, but in \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, it is only assumed that $\supp \mu_\alpha \subseteq K_\alpha$.
In particular, not every lamination admits a transverse measure.

% The definition of transverse measure in terms of Radon measures on $K_\alpha$ is convenient because $K_\alpha$ is compact.
% However, the definition is not intrinsic, and this causes problems when considering questions of convergence: the fact that the flow boxes of a convergent sequence of measured laminations converge should be a consequence of, not a part of, the definition.

% To rectify this, we first observe that in the definition of a transverse measure, we cannot define a transverse measure to be a positive measure on the support of $\supp \lambda$.
% For such a notion of transversality, Lebesgue measure would be transverse to every foliation on $\RR^d$!

Now suppose that $\lambda$ is \dfn{oriented} -- that is, all its transition maps are orientation-preserving.
Then we can define measure convergence in terms of its Ruelle-Sullivan current \cite{Ruelle75}.

\begin{definition}
Let $(\lambda, \mu)$ be a measured, oriented, tangentially $C^1$ lamination, and let $(\chi_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}$ be a subordinate partition of unity.
The \dfn{Ruelle-Sullivan current} $T_\mu$ associated to $(\lambda, \mu)$ is defined for all compactly supported $d-1$-forms $\varphi$ by
\begin{equation}\label{RS current}
\int_M T_\mu \wedge \varphi := \sum_{\alpha \in A} \int_{K_\alpha} \left[\int_{\{k\} \times J} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* (\chi_\alpha \varphi) \right] \dif \mu_\alpha(k).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A sequence of measured, tangentially $C^1$ laminations $(\lambda_i, \mu_i)$ \dfn{converges} to $(\lambda, \mu)$ if their local Ruelle-Sullivan currents $T_{\mu_i} \to T_\mu$ converge in the weak topology of measures.
\end{definition}

The convergence of Ruelle-Sullivan currents, which is very convenient to work with analytically, is equivalent to a definition of measure convergence that may be more familiar to topologists, namely convergence of the transverse measure along each transverse curve.
We recall this fact in Appendix \ref{transverse curves}.

How are the above modes of convergence related?
It is clear from the definitions that flow-box convergence implies Thurston convergence, and it is well-known that measure convergence implies Thurston convergence \cite[Proposition 8.10.3]{thurston1979geometry}.
We show that flow-box convergence actually sits in the middle of the chain of implications.

\begin{definition}
A sequence $(\lambda_n)$ of laminations has \dfn{bounded curvature} if there exists $C > 0$ such that for any $n$ and any leaf $N$ of $\lambda_n$, the second fundamental form satisfies $\|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \leq C$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{implication theorem}
Let $M$ be a manifold of constant sectional curvature and dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$.
Let $(\lambda_n, \mu_n)$ be measured minimal laminations in $M$, and $(\lambda_n, \mu_n) \to (\lambda, \mu)$.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ in Thurston's geometric topology.
	\item If $(\lambda_n)$ has bounded curvature, then $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ in the $C^{1-}$ flow box topology.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We also complement Theorem \ref{implication theorem} with some compactness results for the above modes of convergence.

\begin{theorem}\label{compactness theorem}
Let $M$ be a manifold of dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$.
Let $(\lambda_n)$ be a sequence of minimal laminations of bounded curvature, and assume that for some compact set $E \Subset M$ and every leaf $N$ of $\lambda_n$, $N \cap E$ is nonempty. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A subsequence converges in the $C^{1-}$ flow box topology, and in particular in Thurston's geometric topology, to a minimal lamination.
\item If $\mu_n$ is transverse to $\lambda_n$ and there exists $C > 0$ such that $\mu_n(M) \leq C$, then a further subsequence converges in the measure topology.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Best Lipschitz and least gradient maps}\label{FLG section}
Geodesic laminations are of great interest to the Thurston school of geometric topology \cite[Chapter 8]{thurston1979geometry}.
Later Thurston introduced \dfn{best Lipschitz maps}, namely maps $v: M \to N$ between closed manifolds which minimize their Lipschitz constant $\Lip(v)$ subject to a constraint on their homotopy class.
These maps define a geodesic lamination whose support is the set of points $x$ so that the local Lipschitz constant of $v$ at $x$ is equal to $\Lip(v)$ \cite{thurston1998minimal}.
If $M, N$ are hyperbolic surfaces of the same genus $g$, then $\Lip(v)$ is the distance between $M$ and $N$ in \dfn{Thurston's asymmetric metric} on Teichm\"uller space.
This circle of ideas has been developed by the Thurston school \cite{papadopoulos:hal-00129729} but has recently also made contact with geometric PDE through the work of Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse,daskalopoulosPrep1}.

To be more precise, if $M$ is a closed hyperbolic manifold, then the Euler-Lagrange equation for best Lipschitz maps $v: M \to \Sph^1$ is the $\infty$-Laplace equation
\begin{equation}\label{infinity laplacian}
	\langle \nabla^2 v, \nabla v \otimes \nabla v\rangle = 0.
\end{equation}
Thus, every \dfn{$\infty$-harmonic function} -- that is, a viscosity solution of (\ref{infinity laplacian}) -- is best Lipschitz \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
The $\infty$-Laplace equation is invariant under translations $v \mapsto v + y$, so by Noether's theorem, it has a conserved flux $\dif u$.
If $d = 2$, the associated conservation law is the $1$-Laplace equation
\begin{equation}\label{1Laplacian}
\dif^* \left(\frac{\dif u}{|\dif u|}\right) = 0.
\end{equation}
A \dfn{$1$-harmonic function}, or variational solution of (\ref{1Laplacian}), is a minimizer $u$ of the total variation energy
\begin{equation}\label{least gradient functional}
	\int_M \star |\dif u| \leq \int_M \star |\dif u + \dif w|
\end{equation}
subject to the Dirichlet condition $\supp w \Subset M$.

Formally, the $1$-Laplace equation (\ref{1Laplacian}) asserts that the level sets are minimal surfaces, but one has to verify this rigorously for variational solutions.
This is the main result of the prequel paper \cite{BackusFLG}:

\begin{theorem}\label{main thm of old paper}
Let $M$ be a manifold of constant sectional curvature and $2 \leq d \leq 7$.
Then for every $1$-harmonic function $u: M \to \RR$ and $y \in \RR$, the level set $\partial \{u > y\}$ is an analytic embedded stable minimal hypersurface in $M$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
By a straightfoward modification of \cite[Theorem 1]{BOMBIERI1969}, the superlevel sets $\{u > y\}$ have least perimeter, that is their indicator functions have least gradient.
The regularity of boundaries of sets of least perimeter was established for $M = \RR^d$ by de Giorgi's lemma \cite{Miranda66} but the proof does not generalize nicely, because it relies on the invariance of tangent vectors under parallel transport in order to define averages of normal vectors to sets of least perimeter.
In \cite[\S3]{BackusFLG} we establish a suitable method of taking averages of the normal vector provided that $M = \Hyp^d$ or $M = \Sph^d$.
This allows us to modify the relevant parts of \cite{Miranda66}.
See \cite[\S1]{BackusFLG} for a more detailed summary of \cite{BackusFLG}.
\end{proof}

We use Theorem \ref{main thm of old paper} as a regularity result at various points in this paper, which allows us to show that the limiting laminations have smooth leaves (rather than currents for leaves, say).
However, Theorem \ref{main thm of old paper} is of more interest to this paper rather than just as a regularity lemma; to motivate why, we recall the relationship between best Lipschitz maps, maps of least gradient, and geodesic laminations:

\begin{theorem}[Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck]\label{DU theorem}
Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic surface and $v: M \to \Sph^1$ an $\infty$-harmonic function with maximal stretch geodesic lamination $\lambda$ and conserved flux $T$. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ is the Ruelle-Sullivan current for a measured oriented structure on $\lambda$.
\item There exists a $1$-harmonic, $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant function $u: \Hyp^2 \to \RR$ such that $\dif u$ is a lift of $T$ to the universal cover $\Hyp^2$.
\item Every level set of $u$ is the lift of a geodesic of $\lambda$ to $\Hyp^2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We refer to the original paper \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse} for a more precise statement.
Inspired by this theorem, Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck conjectured that for any $1$-harmonic function on $\Hyp^2$, $\dif u$ should be Ruelle-Sullivan for some (possibly not maximum-stretch) geodesic lamination \cite[Problem 9.4]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, and conversely that if $T$ is a Ruelle-Sullivan current for some geodesic lamination, then local primitives of $T$ are $1$-harmonic \cite[Conjecture 9.5]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Of course, if $d \geq 3$, then the level sets will be minimal hypersurfaces rather than geodesics.

Using Theorem \ref{compactness theorem}, the stable Bernstein theorem \cite{Schoen2016, Chodosh2021}, and Theorem \ref{main thm of old paper}, we prove the conjectures of Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck:

\begin{theorem}\label{main thm}
Let $M$ be a manifold of constant sectional curvature and dimension $2 \leq d \leq 4$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $u$ be a $1$-harmonic function on $M$.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bigcup_{y \in \RR} \partial \{u > y\}$ is the support of a minimal lamination $\lambda$.
\item The leaves of $\lambda$ are the connected components of the level sets $\partial \{u > y\}$.
\item There is a measured oriented structure on $\lambda$ whose Ruelle-Sullivan current is $\dif u$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Conversely, if $\lambda$ is a minimal measured oriented lamination with Ruelle-Sullivan current $T$, and $\tilde M \to M$ is the universal cover of $M$, then there exists a $1$-harmonic, $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant function $u: \tilde M \to \RR$, such that $\dif u$ drops to $T$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

However, Theorem \ref{main thm} leaves a key point -- the role of the $\infty$-Laplacian -- open, and we have not attempted to address this point here.
The Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck theorem was our main motivation for this series of papers; however, our work works in dimensions $d = 3, 4$ while Theorem \ref{DU theorem} is purely a statement about $d = 2$.
Indeed, the $\infty$-Laplacian gives geodesic laminations, but the $1$-Laplacian gives codimension-$1$ laminations, which are not geodesic if $d \geq 3$, so there is not an obvious generalization of Theorem \ref{DU theorem} for $d = 3, 4$.

It is tantalizing to think that a suitable system of coupled $\infty$-Laplacians will satisfy a generalized maximum-stretch condition on a codimension-$1$ minimal lamination $\lambda$, and that the conservation law for this conjectural system will be the $1$-Laplacian.
However, even if one was to derive such a system of $\infty$-Laplacians formally, the analysis for studying such a system would likely not be in place.
Indeed, the study of $\infty$-harmonic functions is almost entirely carried out in the language of viscosity solutions and comparison-with-cones, which only make sense when the target is $\RR$ rather than $\RR^m$ or a vector bundle.
Even so, we hope to return to this question in a later work: what is the correct generalization of the Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck theorem to closed hyperbolic threefolds?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Outline of the paper}
In \S\ref{Prelims} we recall preliminaries.

In \S\ref{Regularity} we establish that every $C^0$ minimal lamination has a Lipschitz laminar atlas and a Lipschitz normal bundle, and is tangentially $C^\infty$.
We will use this regularity frequently through the remainder of the paper.

In \S\ref{CompactnessSec} we prove Theorems \ref{implication theorem}, \ref{compactness theorem}, and \ref{main thm}.

We also include Appendix \ref{transverse curves}, where we explain why our definition of convergence in the weak topology of measures is equivalent to a more standard definition.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{Prelims}
\subsection{Notation and conventions}
The operator $\star$ is the Hodge star, thus $\star 1$ is the Riemannian measure.
We denote the musical isomorphisms by $\sharp, \flat$.
If $U$ is an open set, we write $|U| := \int_U \star 1$ for the volume of $U$, but if $U$ is a submanifold or rectifiable set of positive codimension, we instead write $|U|$ for its surface measure.
We write $\normal_N$ for the normal vector (or conormal $1$-form) for a hypersurface $N$, $\nabla_N$ for the Levi-Civita connection, and $\Two_N := \nabla_N \normal_N$ for the second fundamental form.

We consider the following manifolds: $\Ball^d$ is the unit ball in $\RR^d$, $\Sph^d$ the unit sphere in $\RR^{d + 1}$, and $\Hyp^d$ is the hyperbolic space.

For a map $F: X \to Y$ between metric spaces, we write $\Lip(F)$ for its Lipschitz constant.
If $X, Y$ are connected Riemannian manifolds, one of which is $1$-dimensional, then we have $\Lip(F) = \|\dif F\|_{L^\infty}$.

We let $\Leaves \lambda$ denote the set of leaves of a lamination $\lambda$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Hausdorff distance}
% In order to measure when two leaves are ``close'', we shall consider the Hausdorff distance on the space of leaves, as defined in \cite[Chapter 4]{nadler2017continuum}.

% \begin{definition}
% Let $X$ be a compact metric space. The \dfn{Hausdorff distance} between two nonempty closed sets $A, B \subset X$ is
% \begin{equation}\label{compact hausdorff distance}
% 	\dist(A, B) := \max\left(\max_{a \in A} \min_{b \in B} \dist(a, b), \max_{b \in B} \min_{a \in A} \dist(a, b)\right).
% \end{equation}
% The space of closed subsets of $X$ is the \dfn{hyperspace} $\Hypspace X$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}
% If $X$ is a metrizable space and $(A_n)$ is a sequence of closed subsets of $X$, we define
% \begin{equation}\label{Hausdorff is the limit set}
% \lim_{n \to \infty} A_n := \left\{\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n: (x_n) \in \prod_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right\}.
% \end{equation}
% \end{definition}

% \begin{proposition}\label{Hausdorff on a CMS}
% Let $X$ be a compact metric space. Then:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item The topology on $\Hypspace X$ is the topology for the convergence mode (\ref{Hausdorff is the limit set}).
% \item The topology on $\Hypspace X$ is completely determined by the topology on $X$.
% \item $\Hypspace X$ is a compact metric space.
% \end{enumerate}
% In particular, $\Hypspace$ is a self-map of the set of compact metrizable spaces.
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
% By \cite[Theorem 4.11]{nadler2017continuum}, a sequence $(A_n)$ of closed subsets of $X$, the limit $A$ in $\Hypspace X$ of $A_n$ is the set of $x \in X$ such that for every $U \ni x$ open, there are $x_n \in A_n$ such that eventually $x_n \in U$.
% But this is exactly the characterization of $\lim_n A_n$ given by (\ref{Hausdorff is the limit set}).
% It is also independent of the metric on $X$, so as a metrizable space, $\Hypspace X$ is determined by the metrizable (rather than metric) structure on $X$.
% The compactness now follows from \cite[Theorem 4.17]{nadler2017continuum}, and the fact that $\Hypspace$ is a self-map of the space of compact metrizable spaces follows.

\subsection{Measure theory}\label{MeasurePrelims}
Let $X$ be a metrizable space, and let $C_\cpt(X)$ be the space of compactly supported continuous functions $f: X \to \RR$.
Its dual $C_\cpt(X)'$ is canonically isomorphic to the space of signed Radon measures on $X$, where the bilinear pairing is given by integration.
The weak topology on $C_\cpt(X)'$ is known as the \dfn{weak topology of measures}.
Unpacking the definitions, a sequence $(\mu_n)$ of Radon measures converges to $\mu$ in the weak topology of measures iff for every continuous function $f: X \to \RR$,
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f \dif \mu_n = \int_X f \dif \mu.$$
We shall frequently use the following characterization of weak convergence:

\begin{proposition}[portmanteau theorem]
	Let $(\mu_n)$ be a sequence of positive Radon measures on a compact metrizable space $X$ with $\mu_n(X) \lesssim 1$, and let $\mu$ be a Radon measure on $X$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\mu_n \to \mu$ in the weak topology of measures.
	\item $\liminf_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(X) \geq \mu(X)$ and for every closed $Y \subseteq X$, $\limsup_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(Y) \leq \mu(Y)$.
	\item $\limsup_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(X) \leq \mu(X)$ and for every open $Z \subseteq X$, $\liminf_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(Z) \geq \mu(Z)$.
	\item For every $W \subseteq X$ with $\mu(\partial W) = 0$, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(W) = \mu(W)$.
\end{enumerate}
	If $X$ is a manifold, these conditions are equivalent to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{4}
	\item For every $x \in X$ and almost every $0 < \varepsilon \ll 1$, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(B(x, \varepsilon)) = \mu(B(x, \varepsilon))$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	See \cite[Theorem 13.16]{klenke2013probability} for the metrizable case.
	For the manifold case, we just observe that almost every $\varepsilon > 0$ satisfies $\mu(\partial B(x, \varepsilon)) = 0$. Indeed, if not, then we can find a set of real numbers $A$ such that $0$ is a condensation point of $A$, and for every $\varepsilon \in A$, $\mu(\partial B(x, \varepsilon)) > 0$.
	In particular, for every $\delta > 0$, $A \cap (0, \delta)$ is uncountable, so
	$$\mu(B(x, \delta)) \geq \sum_{\varepsilon \in A \cap (0, \delta)} \mu(\partial B(x, \delta)) = \infty,$$
	but since $X$ is a manifold, if $\delta$ is small enough then $B(x, \delta)$ is precompact.
	This contradicts that $\mu$ is a Radon measure.
\end{proof}

There are subtleties involved in the portmanteau theorem for noncompact $X$.
However, this will never be an issue, as we shall only use it locally, in small precompact balls.

If $X = M$ is a manifold, then we can consider instead the space $C_\cpt(M, \Omega^\ell)$ of compactly supported continuous $\ell$-forms.
An $\ell$-\dfn{current} is an element of the dual space $C_\cpt(M, \Omega^\ell)'$.\footnote{Strictly speaking, $C_\cpt(M, \Omega_\ell)'$ is the space of $\ell$-currents of locally finite total variation. However, we will never need to consider $\ell$-currents that do not have locally finite total variation, so we suppress this technicality.}
We denote the pairing of an $\ell$-current $T$ and an $\ell$-form $\varphi$ by $\int_M T \wedge \varphi$.
Any $d-\ell$-form $\psi$ gives rise to an $\ell$-current $T$, the \dfn{Poincar\'e dual} of $\psi$, by $\int_M T \wedge \varphi = \int_M \psi \wedge \varphi$.
In particular, the Poincar\'e dual of any function is a $d$-current.
Again we have the \dfn{weak topology of measures} on the space of $\ell$-currents.

\begin{definition}
Let $T$ be an $\ell$-current.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\psi \mapsto \int_M T \wedge \dif \psi$ extends from $C^1_\cpt(M, \Omega^{\ell - 1})$ to an $\ell - 1$-current, we define the \dfn{exterior derivative}
$$\int_M \dif T \wedge \psi := -\int_M T \wedge \dif \psi.$$
\item We define a positive Radon measure $\star |T|$, the \dfn{total variation}, by
$$\int_M f \star |T| := \sup_{|\varphi| \leq |f|} \int_M T \wedge \varphi.$$
\item We define the \dfn{polar part} $\psi$ of $T$ by 
$$\int_M T \wedge \varphi = \int_M (\psi \wedge \varphi)|T|.$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

See \cite{simon1983GMT} for more on the theory of currents.
The polar part is well-defined by \cite[Theorem 4.14]{simon1983GMT}.

% The following version of the Arzela-Ascoli theorem is well-known, but for convenience we recall it.

% \begin{proposition}[Arzela-Ascoli theorem]\label{AA Holder}
% Suppose that $(u_n)$ is a sequence of Lipschitz functions with bounded Lipschitz norms on a compact metric space. Then there is a subsequence of $(u_n)$ which converges in $C^{1-}$ to a Lipschitz function.
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
% By the classical Arzela-Ascoli theorem, along a subsequence we have $u_n \to u$ in $C^0$, where
% $$|u(x) - u(y)| \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} |u_n(x) - u_n(y)| + 2 \|u_n - u\|_{C^0} \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \Lip(u_n) \cdot \dist(x, y)$$
% and hence
% $$\Lip(u) \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \Lip(u_n) < \infty.$$
% Now let $0 < \alpha < 1$, and assume without loss of generality that $u = 0$, so that we must show that $\|u_n\|_{C^\alpha} \to 0$.
% In fact,
% $$\frac{|u_n(x) - u_n(y)|}{\dist(x, y)^\alpha} = \left|\frac{u_n(x) - u_n(y)}{\dist(x, y)}\right|^\alpha \cdot |u_n(x) - u_n(y)|^\alpha \leq \Lip(u_n)^\alpha \cdot \|u_n\|_{C^0}^{1 - \alpha}.$$
% Since $u_n \to 0$ in $C^0$, and $(\Lip(u_n))$ is uniformly bounded, the claim follows.
% \end{proof}

With the measure-theoretic machinery above in place, we recall some facts about Ruelle-Sullivan currents.
Let $(\lambda, \mu)$ be a measured, oriented, tangentially $C^1$ lamination.
Then the Ruelle-Sullivan current $T_\mu$ is a well-defined closed $d-1$-current \cite[Theorem 8.2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}. 
In particular, we may lift $T_\mu$ to the universal cover $\tilde M$, where it is exact \cite[Theorem 8.3]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Moreover, $T_\mu$ has an intrinsic definition as the unique $d-1$-current with a certain polar decomposition.
To be more precise, recall that $\mu$ defines a measure on $\supp \lambda$: in each flow box $F_\alpha$, an open set $U$ has measure
\begin{equation}\label{transverse measure of an open set}
\mu(U) := \int_{K_\alpha} |F_\alpha(\{k\} \times J) \cap U| \dif \mu_\alpha(k).
\end{equation}

% \begin{proof}
% We first claim that the right-hand side of (\ref{RS current}) is always finite, and is continuous in $\varphi$.
% In fact, possibly after refining $(\chi_\alpha)$, we may assume that it is a locally finite partition of unity.
% In particular, we just need to check the continuity in a single flow box:
% $$\left|\int_{K_\alpha} \left[\int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* (\chi_\alpha \varphi) \right] \dif \mu_\alpha(k)\right| \leq \int_{K_\alpha} \int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} |(F_\alpha^{-1})^* (\chi_\alpha \varphi)| \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
% The inner integral is controlled by $\|\varphi\|_{C^0(U_\alpha)} \cdot |U_\alpha|$ where $U_\alpha$ is the image of $F_\alpha$.
% The outer integral is then well-defined because it is against a Radon measure.

% We next observe that the choice of partition of unity is irrelevant, thus if $\varphi$ has compact support in $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$, then
% \begin{equation}\label{well-defined of Ruelle-Sullivan}
% \int_{K_\alpha} \int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* \varphi \dif \mu_\alpha(k) = \int_{K_\beta} \int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\beta^{-1})^* \varphi \dif \mu_\beta(k).
% \end{equation}
% Indeed,
% \begin{align*}
% \int_{K_\alpha} \int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* \varphi \dif \mu_\alpha(k)
% &= \int_{K_\beta} (F_\alpha F_\beta^{-1})^* \left[\int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* \varphi \dif \mu_\alpha(k)\right] \\
% &= \int_{K_\beta} \left[\int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\beta^{-1})^* \varphi\right] (F_\alpha F_\beta^{-1})^* \dif \mu_\beta(k) \\
% &= \int_{K_\beta} \int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\beta^{-1})^* \varphi \dif \mu_\beta(k)
% \end{align*}
% where the last equation is because of the measure-preserving nature of the transition maps; this proves (\ref{well-defined of Ruelle-Sullivan}).

% Finally, if a $d-2$-form $\psi$ has compact support in a single flow box, then
% $$\int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* \dif \psi = \int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} \dif((F_\alpha^{-1})^* \psi) = 0$$
% by Stokes' theorem, so
% \begin{align*}
% \int_M \dif T_\mu \wedge \psi &= -\int_M T_\mu \wedge \dif \psi \\
% &= -\int_{K_\alpha} \int_{\RR^{d - 1} \times \{k\}} (F_\alpha^{-1})^* \dif \psi \dif \mu_\alpha(k) = 0. \qedhere
% \end{align*}
% \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
For a measured, oriented, tangentially $C^1$ lamination $(\lambda, \mu)$, with Lipschitz normal vector $\normal_\lambda$, the polar decomposition of $T_\mu$ is
\begin{equation}\label{polar ruelle sullivan}
T_\mu = \normal_\lambda \mu.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For an open set $U \subseteq M$ in a flow box $F_\alpha$, the total variation satisfies
$$\int_U \star |T_\mu| = \sup_{\|\varphi\|_{C^0} \leq 1} \int_{K_\alpha} \int_{\{k\} \times J} \varphi \dif \mu_\alpha(k)$$
where the supremum ranges over $d-1$-forms $\varphi$ with compact support in $U$.
However, $\star \normal_\lambda^\flat$ is the Riemannian measure on $F_\alpha(\{k\} \times J)$, so
$$\int_{\{k\} \times J} \varphi \leq \int_{\{k\} \times J} (F_\alpha^{-1})^*(\star \normal_\lambda^\flat).$$
Since $\|\normal^\lambda\|_{C^0} = 1$, it follows that a sequence of cutoffs of $\star \normal_\lambda^\flat$ to more and more of $U$ is a maximizing sequence.
Therefore $\normal_\lambda$ is the polar part of (\ref{polar ruelle sullivan}), and
$$\int_U \star |T_\mu| = \int_{K_\alpha} \int_{\{k\} \times J} (F_\alpha^{-1})^*(1_U \star \normal_\lambda^\flat) \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
The inner integral is the Riemannian measure of $F_\alpha(\{k\} \times J) \cap U$, so by (\ref{transverse measure of an open set}), $|T_\mu| = \mu$.
\end{proof}

The above computation motivates the definition of Ruelle-Sullivan current of a \emph{nonorientable} lamination.
To be more precise, if $\lambda$ is a nonorientable lamination with normal vector field $\normal_\lambda$, then we can view $\normal_\lambda$ as a section of a (necessarily twisted) line bundle $L$ over $M$.
We can then define $T_\mu$ to be $\normal_\lambda \mu$, which makes sense as a distributional section of $L$, and can be tested against any continuous $d-1$-form on $M$ whose support is contained in a contractible set.
In particular, we shall speak of the Ruelle-Sullivan current of any measured lamination, even if it is nonorientable.

\begin{lemma}\label{convergence of normals}
If $(\lambda_n, \mu_n) \to (\lambda, \mu)$, $x_n \in \supp \lambda_n$ converges to $x \in \supp \lambda$, and $(\lambda_n), \lambda$ have continuous normal vector fields $(\normal_n), \normal$, then $\normal_n(x_n) \to \normal(x)$ pointwise.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Choose a continuous $d-1$-form $\varphi$ which extends $\star \normal^\flat$.
	Then for every $\varepsilon > 0$,
	$$\int_{B(x, \varepsilon)} T_\mu \wedge \varphi = \mu(B(x, \varepsilon))$$
	so by the portmanteau theorem, for almost every $\varepsilon > 0$,
	\begin{equation}\label{epsilon is a continuity set}
		\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\int_{B(x, \varepsilon)} T_{\mu_n} \wedge \varphi}{\mu_n(B(x, \varepsilon))} = \frac{\int_{B(x, \varepsilon)} T_\mu \wedge \varphi}{\mu(B(x, \varepsilon))} = 1.
	\end{equation}
	On the other hand, if we assume that there exist $\delta, \varepsilon > 0$ and a coordinate system such that for every $y \in \supp \lambda_n \cap B(x, \varepsilon)$,
	$$|\normal_n - \normal| \geq \delta,$$
	then possibly after shrinking $\varepsilon$ we may assume that (\ref{epsilon is a continuity set}) holds, hence by (\ref{polar ruelle sullivan}),
	$$\int_{B(x, \varepsilon)} T_{\mu_n} \wedge \varphi = \int_{B(x, \varepsilon)} \normal_n^\flat \wedge \star \normal^\flat \dif \mu_i \leq (1 - O(\delta)) \mu_n(B(x, \varepsilon))$$
	and therefore $\delta = 0$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Calculus of variations}
We record various well-known facts about $1$-harmonic functions and minimal surfaces.

\begin{proposition}[Miranda stability theorem]
  Suppose that $M$ is a compact manifold, possibly with boundary.
	If a sequence of functions $(u_n)$ (not necessarily of the same trace) is bounded in $L^1(M)$ and satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{boundedness in Miranda}
	\limsup_{n \to \infty} \int_M \star |\dif u_n| \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \inf_{v|_{\partial M} = 0} \int_M \star |\dif(u_n + v)| < \infty,
\end{equation}
	then there exists a function $u$ of least gradient such that along a subsequence, $u_n \to u$ in $L^1(M)$ and $\dif u_n \to \dif u$ in the weak topology of measures.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The forgetful map $BV(M) \to L^1(M)$ is compact, so (\ref{boundedness in Miranda}) and the bounds in $L^1(M)$ imply that $(u_n)$ has a convergent subsequence.
The rest of the proof is similar to \cite[Teorema 3 and Osservazione 3]{Miranda67}; see \todo{\cite{BackusFLG}} for the straightforward modifications.
\end{proof}

% \begin{proposition}[maximum principle]\label{max princip}
% Let $u$ be a $1$-harmonic function.
% If $u$ attains a local maximum, then $u$ is constant.
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
% Let $y$ be a local maximum of $u$; then $\partial \{u \geq y\}$ is a minimal hypersurface by Theorem \ref{main thm of old paper}, or else it is empty. If it is empty, then $M = \{u \geq y\}$ and $u$ is constant, so we exclude this case.
% In a neighborhood of any point of $\partial \{u \geq y\}$ we may decrease $\int \star |\dif u|$ by decreasing $y$ a small amount, which violates that $u$ has least gradient.
% \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[stable Bernstein theorem]
	Let $M$ be a manifold of bounded geometry, and dimension $d \in \{2, 3, 4\}$.
	Then there exists $A \geq 0$ such that for every complete stable minimal hypersurface $N$ in $M$ with trivial normal bundle,
	$$|\Two_N(P)| \leq \frac{A}{1 + \dist(P, \partial M)}.$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	If $d = 2$ this clearly holds with $A = 0$.
	If $d = 3$ this was proven in \cite{Schoen2016}, and we refer to \cite[Theorem 2.10]{colding2011course} for a modern proof.
	If $d = 4$ this result can be derived from \cite[Theorem 1]{Chodosh2021} using the sort of techniques discussed in \cite[\S3]{White13}.
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Regularity of flow boxes}\label{Regularity}
The goal of this section is to prove the following regularity theorem for minimal laminations that we will use several times.
The proof is based on \cite[Theorem 1.1]{Solomon86}, which addresses the case that $\lambda$ is a minimal foliation, and does not explictly spell out the quantitative regularity of the laminar atlas.
Lipschitz regularity is optimal even for the nicest case of a geodesic foliation of $\Hyp^2$ \cite[\S1]{Solomon86}, so this result is sharp.

\begin{proposition}\label{regularity theorem}
Let $(M, g)$ be a Riemannian manifold of dimension $d \geq 2$ and bounded geometry.
Let $\lambda$ be a minimal lamination in $M$ such that for some $A > 0$ and every leaf $N \in \Leaves \lambda$,
\begin{equation}\label{curvature bound in regularity}
	\|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \leq A.
\end{equation}
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a Lipschitz line bundle on $M$ which is normal to every leaf of $\lambda$.
\item There exist constants $L = L(g, A) > 0$ and $r = r(g, A) > 0$, and a Lipschitz laminar atlas $(F_\alpha)$ for $\lambda$, such that for every $\alpha$,
\begin{equation}\label{conorm of flow box}
	\max(\Lip(F_\alpha), \Lip(F_\alpha^{-1})) \leq L,
\end{equation}
and the image of $F_\alpha$ contains a ball of radius $r$.
\item $F_\alpha$ is tangentially $C^\infty$, with seminorms only depending on $A, g$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

To begin the proof we first consider when we can represent the leaves of $\lambda$ as graphs in a uniform way.

\begin{lemma}\label{existence of tubes}
	Let $N$ be a connected hypersurface in $\RR^d = \RR^{d - 1}_x \times \RR_y$ which is tangent to $\{y = 0\}$ at the origin.
	If $\|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \leq \log(5/4)$, then for every $(x, y) \in N \cap B_1$,
	$$\max(|y|, 0.5 \cdot |\normal_N(x, y) - \partial_y|) \leq \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}.$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Near $0$, $N$ can be represented a graph $\{y = f(x)\}$, since it is tangent to $\{y = 0\}$.
	This representation is valid on the component of the set $\{|\nabla f(x)| < \infty\}$ containing $0$, and it is related to the unit normal by
\begin{equation}\label{nabla as a normal}
	\nabla f(x) = \frac{\partial_y - \normal(x, f(x))}{\sqrt{1 + |\nabla f(x)|^2}}.
\end{equation}
	Taking derivatives of both sides,
	$$-\nabla^2 f(x) = \frac{\nabla \normal(x, f(x)) \cdot (\partial_x \otimes \partial_x + \nabla f(x) \otimes \partial_y)}{\sqrt{1 + |\nabla f(x)|^2}} + \frac{\nabla^2 f(x) \cdot (\nabla f(x) \otimes (\partial_y - \normal(x, f(x))))}{(1 + |\nabla f|^2)^{3/2}}.$$
	Here $-\nabla^2$ denotes the negative Hessian, not the Laplacian.
	We can use (\ref{nabla as a normal}) to bound
	$$|\partial_y - \normal(x, f(x))| \leq |\nabla f(x)|\sqrt{1 + |\nabla f(x)|^2} \leq |\nabla f(x)| + |\nabla f(x)|^2.$$
	Since
	$$|\partial_x \otimes \partial_x + \nabla f(x) \otimes \partial_y| \leq \sqrt{1 + |\nabla f(x)|^2},$$
	and $\nabla \normal = \Two_N$, we conclude
\begin{equation}\label{bound Hessian by Two}
	|\nabla^2 f(x)| \leq |\Two_N(x, f(x))| + |\nabla^2 f(x)| (|\nabla f(x)|^2 + |\nabla f(x)|^3).
\end{equation}

	In order to control the error terms in (\ref{bound Hessian by Two}), we make the \dfn{bootstrap assumption}
\begin{equation}\label{bootstrap}
	|\nabla f(x)| \leq 1/4,
\end{equation}
	which is at least valid in some small neighborhood $B_R$ of $0$ since (\ref{nabla as a normal}) and the fact that $N$ is tangent to $\{y = 0\}$ at $0$ imply that $\nabla f(0) = 0$.
	One can show using Taylor's theorem that (\ref{bootstrap}) implies that 
	$$\frac{1}{1 - |\nabla f(x)|^2 - |\nabla f(x)|^3} \leq 1 + |\nabla f(x)|,$$
	so by (\ref{bound Hessian by Two}),
	$$|\nabla^2 f(x)| \leq \frac{\|\Two_N\|_{C^0}}{1 - |\nabla f(x)|^2 - |\nabla f(x)|^3} \leq \|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \cdot (1 + |\nabla f(x)|).$$
	If we write $x = (r, \theta)$, then by the mean value theorem, it follows that for $r \leq R$,
\begin{align*}
	|\nabla f(x)| &\leq \|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \int_0^r 1 + |\nabla f(s, \theta)| \dif s.
\end{align*}
	So by Gr\"onwall's inequality,
\begin{align*}
	|\nabla f(x)| &\leq r \|\Two_N\|_{C^0} + \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}^2 \int_0^r s \exp(\|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \cdot (r - s)) \dif s \\
	&= r \|\Two_N\|_{C^0} + \exp(r \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}) - r \|\Two_N\|_{C^0} - 1 \\
	&= \exp(r \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}) - 1.
\end{align*}
	Recalling that $\|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \leq \log(5/4)$, and $r \leq R < 1$, we conclude that on $B_R$, $|\nabla f| < 1/4$.
	That is, we recover the bootstrap assumption (\ref{bootstrap}) on some ball $B_{R'}$ for some $R' > R$, and hence on the entire ball $B_1$.

	By the mean value theorem again,
\begin{align*}
	|f(x)| &\leq \int_0^r |\nabla f(s, \theta)| \dif s \leq \int_0^r \exp(s \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}) - 1 \dif s \\
	&= \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}^{-1} (\exp(r \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}) - r\|\Two_N\| - 1) \\
	&\leq r^2 \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}
\end{align*}
	where we again used the bound $\|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \leq \log(5/4) < 0.25$ to control the higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of $\exp(r \|\Two_N\|_{C^0})$. Since $r < 1$ was arbitrary we conclude $\|f\|_{C^0} \leq \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}$. Moreover, by (\ref{nabla as a normal}),
\begin{align*}
	|\normal(x, f(x)) - \partial_y| &\leq |\nabla f(x)| \leq 2r \|\Two_N\|_{C^0}. \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

Our next lemma guarantees the existence of normal coordinates in which the leaves of $\lambda$ are close to hyperplanes $\{y = y_0\}$.
An analogous result was proven by \cite{Solomon86} (without the quantitative dependence) by a very different means, using the regularity theory for integral flat convergence of minimal currents \cite[Theorem 5.3.14]{federer2014geometric}.
We did not do this, both because \cite{Solomon86} requires that $\lambda$ be a foliation, and because it does not seem particularly easy to recover quantitative bounds from the highly general theory of \cite[Chapter 5]{federer2014geometric}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lams have C0 fields}
	For every sufficiently small $\delta > 0$ there exist $r = r(\delta, g, A) > 0$ such that for every minimal lamination $\lambda$ satisfying (\ref{curvature bound in regularity}) we can choose normal coordinates $(x, y) \in \RR^{d - 1} \times \RR$ on $B(P, r)$ so that
\begin{equation}\label{normal is basically dy}
	\|\normal_\lambda - \partial_y\|_{C^0(B(P, r))} \leq \delta.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose not.
	Then, after rescaling to set $A = 1$, there exist minimal laminations $\lambda_n'$ in $B(P, 1/n)$ such that
	$$\sup_{N \in \Leaves \lambda_n'} \|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \leq 1,$$
	but no matter how we rotate normal coordinates based at $P$, (\ref{normal is basically dy}) fails for $\lambda_n'$.
	By taking normal coordinates and rescaling by $n$, we can find (possibly nonminimal) laminations $\lambda_n$ in $B_1 \subset \RR^d$ such that
% \begin{sublemma}
% 	For each $n \geq \inj(g)$ there exists a lamination $\lambda_n$ in $\RR^d$ so that every rotation of $B_1$ fails (\ref{normal is basically dy}), but satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{bounds on Two in representation}
	\sup_{N \in \Leaves \lambda_n} \|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \lesssim_g \frac{1}{n^2}
\end{equation}
	but for every rotation of $\RR^d$, (\ref{normal is basically dy}) fails.
% \end{sublemma}

% We remark carefully that the lamination in the above sublemma may not be minimal.
% However this fact will be irrelevant.

% \begin{proof}
% 	Since $n \geq \inj(g)$ we can pass to the tangent space and rescale $B(P, 1/n)$ to obtain $B_1$. The scaling makes the second fundamental form $\Two_N'$ with respect to $g$ satisfy
% $$\|\Two_N'\|_{C^0} \leq \frac{e^{-O(n^2)}}{n^2} \lesssim \frac{1}{n^2}.$$
% 	Here and always all implied constants may depend on $g$.
% 	In normal coordinates,
% 	$$g_{\mu \nu} = \delta_{\mu \nu} + \sum_{k=2}^\infty c_k \frac{|x|^k}{n^k},$$
% 	and differentiating this expression gives that the connection $1$-form $\Gamma$ for the Levi-Civita connection $\nabla_g$ satisfies $|\Gamma| \lesssim n^{-2}$.
% 	But $\|\Two_N - \Two_N'\|_{C^0} \lesssim \|\Gamma\|_{C^0}$, since $\Two_N - \Two_N'$ is the difference between the euclidean and $\nabla_g$ derivatives of the conormal.
% \end{proof}

	By Lemma \ref{existence of tubes}, every leaf of $\lambda_n$ is $O(n^{-2})$-close to its tangent spaces in $C^1$.
	In particular, if $n \gg \delta^{-1/2}$, and the normal vector at some point to $N \in \Leaves \lambda_n$ is $\partial_y$, then
	$$\|\normal_N - \partial_y\|_{C^0(B(P, r))} \ll \delta.$$
	We can always impose this for some $N$ by applying a rotation of $\RR^d$.
	But by our contradiction assumption, there exists some leaf $N'$ of $\lambda_n$ and some $P \in N'$ so that $|\normal_{N'}(P) - \partial_y| \geq \delta$ and hence if $n$ is large enough,
	$$\inf_{N'} |\normal_{N'} - \partial_y| \geq \frac{\delta}{2}.$$
	By the reverse triangle inequality it follows that
\begin{equation}\label{discrepancy in normals}
	\inf_{\substack{P \in N\\ P' \in N'}} \sin \angle(\normal_N(P), \normal_{N'}(P')) \gtrsim \delta
\end{equation}
	at least if $\delta$ is smaller than an absolute constant.
	
	In order to obtain a contradiction, we may assume that $r$ is small depending on $\delta$, and consider the restriction of $\lambda_n$ to $B_r$.
	In particular, we may assume that there are points $P \in N \cap B_r$ and $P' \in N' \cap B_r$ for some $r \ll \delta$.
	By (\ref{discrepancy in normals}), the angle $\theta$ between the tangent spaces $T_P N$ and $T_{P'} N'$ is $\gtrsim \delta$, but $|P - P'| \ll \delta$.
	This is only possible if $T_P N$ and $T_{P'} N'$ intersect in some ball $B_{r'}$ for some $r' \ll 1$, say $r' = 1/2$.
	But then, since $N, N'$ are $O(n^{-2})$-close to $T_P N$ and $T_{P'} N'$ in $C^0$, then $N$ and $N'$ intersect in $B_1$ if $n$ is large enough.
	However, $N, N'$ were assumed to be leaves of the same lamination $\lambda_n$ in $B_1$, so this is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{regularity theorem}]
Fix $\delta > 0$ to be chosen later, and $P \in M$.
By Lemma \ref{lams have C0 fields}, there exists $r = r(\delta, g, A) > 0$ such that $B(P, r)$ admits cylindrical, normal coordinates $(x, y) \in 3\Ball^{d - 1} \times (-2, 2)$, and
\begin{equation}\label{normal is almost constant}
\|\normal - \partial_y\|_{C^0(B(P, r))} < \delta.
\end{equation}
If $\delta$ is chosen small enough depending on $g$, then we may assume that in $2\Ball^{d - 1} \times (-1, 1)$,
every leaf is the graph of a function, say $u_k: 3\Ball^{d - 1} \to (-2, 2)$ where $u_k(0) = k$.

If $r$ is chosen small enough depending on $g$ and some $\varepsilon > 0$, then the metric $h$ induced by $g$ on $3\Ball^{d - 1} \times (-2, 2)$ has curvature $\Riem_h$ satisfying $\|\Riem_h\|_{C^0} \leq \varepsilon$.
Writing $Lu = 0$ for the minimal surface equation on $(2\Ball^{d - 1} \times (-1, 1), h)$, it follows that the ellipticity of $L$ and the scale-invariant H\"older norms of $L$ are bounded independently of $\delta$ if $\varepsilon$ is smaller than some absolute constant.
Moreover, $Lu_k = 0$ since the graph of $u_k$ is a minimal surface, and we have $\|u_k\|_{C^0} \leq 2$.
So by a straightforward modification of \cite[Corollary 16.7]{gilbarg2015elliptic}, we have uniformly in $k \in (-1, 1)$ that
\begin{equation}\label{norms on uk}
\|u_k\|_{C^2} \lesssim 1.
\end{equation}

Now let $-1 < k < \ell < 1$, and let $v_{\ell k} := u_\ell - u_k$.
Then $v_{\ell k}$ is the difference of two elements of the kernel of $L$, so $v_{\ell k}$ solves a linear elliptic PDE $Q_{\ell k} v_{\ell k} = 0$.
The ellipticity of $Q_{\ell k}$ and the scale-invariant H\"older norms of $Q_{\ell k}$ only depend on $g$ and $C$, but not on $\ell, k, \delta$.
These assertions about $Q_{\ell k}$ follow from (\ref{norms on uk}) and a routine modification of \cite[Lemma 1.26]{colding2011course}.

Since the graphs of $u_\ell, u_k$ are leaves of a lamination, $v_{\ell k} > 0$.
By the Schauder \cite[Theorem 6.2]{gilbarg2015elliptic} and Harnack \cite[Theorem 9.25]{gilbarg2015elliptic} inequalities applied to the elliptic operator $Q_{\ell k}$, it follows that for every $x \in \Ball^{d - 1}$,
\begin{equation}\label{Schauder Harnack}
	\|\dif v_{\ell k}\|_{C^0(\Ball^{d - 1})} \lesssim \|v_{\ell k}\|_{C^0(2 \Ball^{d - 1})} \lesssim \inf_{\Ball^{d - 1}} v_{\ell k} \leq v_{\ell k}(x).
\end{equation}
In particular, for every $x$,
\begin{equation}\label{bound on du}
|\dif u_\ell(x) - \dif u_k(x)| \lesssim |u_\ell(x) - u_k(x)|
\end{equation}
and it follows that
\begin{equation}\label{vertical Lipschitz}
|\normal(x, u_\ell(x)) - \normal(x, u_k(x))| \lesssim |u_\ell(x) - u_k(x)|.
\end{equation}

To extend (\ref{vertical Lipschitz}) to a Lipschitz bound on $\normal$, let $X_1, X_2 \in (\Ball^{d - 1} \times (-1, 1)) \cap \supp \lambda$.
Then there exist $x_1, x_2 \in \Ball^{d - 1}$ and $k_1, k_2 \in (-1, 1)$ such that $X_i = (x_i, u_{k_i}(x_i))$.
Setting $Y := (x_2, u_{k_1}(x_2))$,
$$|\normal(X_1) - \normal(X_2)| \leq |\normal(X_1) - \normal(Y)| + |\normal(Y) - \normal(X_2)|.$$
Then by (\ref{norms on uk}) and the mean value theorem,
$$|\normal(X_1) - \normal(Y)| \lesssim |\dif u_{k_1}(x_1) - \dif u_{k_1}(x_2)| \lesssim |X_1 - Y|.$$
Moreover, by (\ref{vertical Lipschitz}),
$$|\normal(Y) - \normal(X_2)| \lesssim |u_{k_1}(x) - u_{k_2}(x)| = |Y - X_2|.$$
If $\delta$ is chosen smaller than some absolute constant, then by (\ref{normal is almost constant}),
$$|\sin \angle(X_1 - Y, X_2 - Y)| > 1 - O(\delta)$$
and we conclude by the Pythagorean theorem that
$$|Y - X_2|^2 + |X_1 - Y|^2 \lesssim |X_1 - X_2|^2.$$
In conclusion,
$$|\normal(X_1) - \normal(X_2)| \lesssim |X_1 - X_2|$$
which implies that $\normal$ is Lipschitz on $V \cap \supp \lambda$, where $V$ is the neighborhood of $P$ which was mapped to $\Ball^{d - 1} \times (-1, 1)$ by the cylindrical coordinates $(x, y)$.
In particular, $V$ contains a ball of the form $B(P, s)$, where $s$ only depends on $r$ (and $r$ only depends on $g$ and $A$).
% Moreover, $|X_1 - X_2| \sim r \dist(X_1, X_2)$ by definition of the coordinates $(x, y)$, so we obtain
% \begin{equation}\label{lipschitz normal}
% 	|\Lip(\normal)| \lesssim r^{-1}.
% \end{equation}
Taking a Lipschitz extension of $\normal$ to $V$ we obtain the desired Lipschitz normal subbundle.

Following \cite[Appendix B]{ColdingMinicozziIV}, we construct the laminar flow box
\begin{align*}
	F: \RR^{d - 1}_\xi \times \RR_\eta &\to V \subseteq \RR^{d - 1}_x \times \RR_y \\
	(\xi, \eta) &\mapsto (\xi, f(\xi, \eta))
\end{align*}
by setting
$$f(\xi, \eta) := u_\eta(\xi)$$
if $u_\eta$ exists, and if $k < \eta < \ell$ and there does not $k < \eta' < \ell$ such that $u_{\eta'}$ exists, then
$$f(\xi, \eta) := u_k(\xi) + \frac{\eta - k}{\ell - k} v_{\ell k}(\xi)$$
is the linear interpolant of $u_k$ and $u_\ell$.
It is clear that $F$ is uniformly tangentially $C^\infty$, since $u_k$ and $v_{\ell k}$ are bounded in $C^\infty$ by elliptic bootstrapping.

It remains to show that $F$ is a Lipschitz isomorphism.
To do this, we first claim that $\Lip(f) \sim 1$.
It is clear that $f$ is Lipschitz (in fact, smooth) in the $\xi$ direction, with constant comparable to $\sup_k \|u\|_{C^1} \lesssim 1$ by (\ref{norms on uk}).
If $-1 < k < \ell < 1$, then by (\ref{bound on du}) and (\ref{Schauder Harnack}),
\begin{equation}\label{f lip}
	|f(\xi, k) - f(\xi, \ell)| \lesssim |u_k(\xi) - u_\ell(\xi)| \lesssim \ell - k.
\end{equation}
This shows that $f$ is Lipschitz in the $\eta$ direction on the leaves with constant comparable to $1$, and hence on its entire domain by linear interpolation, proving the claim.

We also need to estimate the co-Lipschitz norm, using (\ref{Schauder Harnack}),
\begin{equation}\label{f colip}
	\frac{|f(\xi, \eta_1) - f(\xi, \eta_2)|}{|\eta_1 - \eta_2|} \geq \inf_{k < \ell} \frac{v_{\ell k}(\xi)}{\ell - k} \gtrsim \inf_{k < \ell} \frac{v_{\ell k}(0)}{\ell - k} = 1.
\end{equation}

We can then estimate using (\ref{f lip})
$$|F(\xi_1, \eta_1) - F(\xi_2, \eta_2)| \lesssim |\xi_1 - \xi_2| + \Lip(f)(|\xi_1 - \xi_2| + |\eta_1 + \eta_2|)$$
so that $\Lip(F) \lesssim 1 + \Lip(f) \lesssim 1$.
One can also use the inverse function theorem and (\ref{f lip}) and (\ref{f colip}) to bound 
$$\Lip(F^{-1}) \lesssim \Lip(f)\left(1 + \sup_\xi \sup_{\eta_1 < \eta_2} \frac{|\eta_1 - \eta_2|}{|f(\xi, \eta_1) - f(\xi, \eta_2)|}\right) \lesssim 1.$$
This implies that $F$ is a Lipschitz isomorphism with Lipschitz constants comparable to $1$.
So the composition of $F$ with the change of coordinates at the start of this proof is a laminar flow box in a small neighborhood of $(0, 0)$ whose image has radius $cr$ for some small $c > 0$, and whose Lipschitz constants are comparable to $O(r^{-1})$.
\end{proof}

\section{Proofs of main theorems}\label{CompactnessSec}
We shall now use Proposition \ref{regularity theorem} to prove Theorems \ref{compactness theorem}, \ref{implication theorem}, and \ref{main thm}.
Throughout, let $M$ be a manifold of constant sectional curvature and dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$.

\subsection{Compactness}
We begin by proving Theorem \ref{compactness theorem}.

Let $P \in M$.
By Proposition \ref{regularity theorem}, there exist $r > 0$ and $L \geq 1$ such that for every large $n \in \NN$, $B(P, r)$ is contained in the image of a flow box $F_n$ for $\lambda_n$ with Lipschitz constant $L$, such that $F_n(0, 0) = P$.
By the Arzela-Ascoli theorem and the interpolation theorem for H\"older spaces, along a subsequence $F_n \to F$ in $C^{1-}$ for some $C^{1-}$ map $F: I \times J \to B(P, r)$ and some $I \subseteq \RR$, $J \subseteq \RR^{d - 1}$, such that on the image $V$ of $F$, $F^{-1}$ is also $C^{1-}$.
Moreover, $F(0, 0) = P$, so that $F: I \times J \to V$ is a Lipschitz isomorphism onto a set which contains $P$.
Since $P$ was arbitrary, it follows that we can find laminar atlases $(F_\alpha^n, K_\alpha^n)$ for each large $n \in \NN$ such that $F_\alpha^n \to F_\alpha$, where the images of $F_\alpha$ and $F_\alpha^n$ are an open cover $(U_\alpha)$ of $M$ independent of $n$, and $(F_\alpha)$ satisfies the usual transition relations.

We now construct the limiting lamination.
Let $\Hypspace I$ be the space of closed subsets of $I$ with its Hausdorff distance; since $I$ is a compact metric space, so is $\Hypspace I$ \cite[Theorem 4.17]{nadler2017continuum}, so we may diagonalize so that for every $\alpha$, either $K^n_\alpha \to K_\alpha$ for some nonempty $K_\alpha$ in the Hausdorff distance on $I$, or for all $n \geq n^*(\alpha)$, $K_\alpha^n$ is empty (in which case we define $K_\alpha = \emptyset$).

In order to ensure that the laminations $\lambda_n$ do not escape to infinity, fix a compact set $E \subseteq M$ such that every leaf of every $\lambda_n$ meets $E$.
Then there exists a finite set $A_E \subseteq A$ such that $E \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A_E} U_\alpha$.

\begin{lemma}\label{label sets are nonempty}
	There exists $\alpha$ such that $K_\alpha$ is nonempty.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose not; then for
	$$n \geq \max_{\alpha \in A_E} n^*(\alpha)$$
	and $\alpha \in A_E$, $K_\alpha^n = \emptyset$, so no leaves of $\lambda_n$ meet $U_\alpha$, and hence no leaves of $\lambda_n$ meet $E$.
	This is a contradiction since $\lambda_n$ has a leaf.
\end{proof}

Now let $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$ and $\psi_{\alpha \beta}^n$ be the transition maps, thus $\psi_{\alpha \beta}^n$ induces a map
$$\psi_{\alpha \beta}^n: K_\alpha^n \to K_\beta^n.$$
By convergence of $(F_\alpha^n)$, $\psi_{\alpha \beta}$ induces a map $K_\alpha \to K_\beta$.

\begin{definition}
	A \dfn{cocycle of labels} $(k_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A'}$ is a set $A' \subseteq A$ and an element of $\prod_{\alpha \in A'} K_\alpha$, such that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The cocycle condition: $k_\beta = \psi_{\alpha \beta}(k_\alpha)$ for $\alpha, \beta \in A'$.
	\item For every $\alpha \in A'$, if $\psi_{\alpha \beta}(k_\alpha)$ is well-defined, then $\beta \in A'$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	Every cocycle of labels $(k_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A'}$ defines a complete minimal hypersurface $N$ such that
	$$N \cap U_\alpha = F_\alpha(\{k_\alpha\} \times J).$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We have the cocycle condition
$$(N \cap U_\alpha) \cap U_\beta = (N \cap U_\beta) \cap U_\alpha$$
which follows from the fact that
\begin{align*}
F_\alpha(\{k_\alpha\} \times J) \cap U_\beta
&= F_\beta(\psi_{\alpha \beta}(\{k_\beta\} \times J)) \cap U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \\
&= F_\beta(\psi_{\alpha \beta}(\{k_\beta\} \times J)) \cap U_\alpha.
\end{align*}
From the cocycle condition, it follows that $N$ honestly defines a Lipschitz hypersurface in $M$, which is complete in $\bigcup_{\alpha \in A'} U_\alpha$.
If $\overline N$ intersects $U_\alpha$ for some $\alpha \notin A'$, then $N$ intersects $U_\beta$ for some $\beta \in A'$ so that $U_\beta \cap U_\alpha \cap \overline N$ is nonempty.
But then $\psi_{\beta \alpha}(k_\beta)$ must be defined, so $\alpha \in A'$, a contradiction.
Therefore $N$ is complete in $M$.

To prove minimality, let
$$u_\alpha(k, x) = 1_{k > k_\alpha}$$
and similarly $u_\alpha^n(k, x) = 1_{k > k_\alpha^n}$ where $(k_\alpha^n) \in \prod_n K_\alpha^n$ converges to $k_\alpha$.
Then the pullback of $u_\alpha^n$ by $F_\alpha \circ (F_\alpha^n)^{-1}$ converges pointwise away from $F_\alpha^{-1}(N \cap U_\alpha)$ to $u_\alpha$, since $k_\alpha^n \to k_\alpha$.
Since $F_\alpha \circ (F_\alpha^n)^{-1}$ converges to the identity map in $C^{1-}$, and $F_\alpha^{-1}(N \cap U_\alpha)$ has zero measure, it follows that $u_\alpha^n \to u_\alpha$ almost everywhere, and hence in $L^1(I \times J)$ by the dominated convergence theorem.
But $u_\alpha^n$ has approximately least gradient in the sense of (\ref{boundedness in Miranda}) with respect to the pullback metric $F_\alpha^* g$, so its limit $u_\alpha$ must have least gradient by the Miranda stability theorem.
Thus by Theorem \ref{main thm of old paper}, $N \cap U_\alpha$ is minimal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $\lambda$ be the lamination with laminar atlas $(F_\alpha, K_\alpha)$.
	Then $\lambda$ is well-defined and minimal.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since 
$$\supp \lambda \cap U_\alpha = K_\alpha \times J$$
and $K_\alpha$ is compact, $\supp \lambda$ is closed.
Now if we choose $\alpha$ such that $K_\alpha$ is nonempty, every element of $K_\alpha$ uniquely determines a cocycle of labels, and hence a leaf of $\lambda$.
So $\supp \lambda$ is nonempty, and since all of its leaves are complete minimal, $\lambda$ is minimal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	$\lambda_n \to \lambda$ in Thurston's geometric topology.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If $K_\alpha$ is nonempty, then any $k_\alpha \in K_\alpha$ is the limit of some sequence $(k_\alpha^n)_n \in \prod_n K_\alpha^n$ \cite[Theorem 4.11]{nadler2017continuum}.
Thus $\{k_\alpha\} \times J$ can be written as the set of limits of sequences $(k_\alpha^n, x)_n \in \prod_n K_\alpha^n \times J$, and so any leaf $N$ of $\lambda$ can be written 
$$N = \left\{\lim_{n \to \infty} P_n: P_n \in N_n\right\}$$
for some sequence $(N_n) \in \prod_n \Leaves \lambda_n$.
In other words, leaves of $\lambda$ are pointwise limits of leaves in $\lambda_n$.

So it suffices to show that for $N \in \Leaves \lambda$, $P \in N$, and $P_n \to P$, where $P_n \in N_n$ and $N_n \in \Leaves \lambda_n$, $\normal_{N_n}(P_n) \to \normal_N(P)$.
To do this, suppose that $P \in U_\alpha$; $F_\alpha^n$ is close in $C^{1-}$ to $F_\alpha$, and the label $k^n_\alpha$ of $N_n$ is close to the label $k_\alpha$ of $N$.
So in some neighborhood $B$ of $P$, $N_n \cap B$ is close to $N \cap B$ in $C^{1-}$.
By assumption, $\|\Two_{N_n \cap B}\|_{C^0} \leq A$ and so $N_n \cap B$ is bounded in $C^2$.
The interpolation theorem for H\"older spaces then implies that $N_n \cap B$ is close to $N \cap B$ in $C^1$, so $\normal_{N_n}(P_n)$ is close to $\normal_N(P)$.
\end{proof}

Finally, suppose that $\mu_n$ is transverse to $\lambda_n$.
After possibly shrinking the $U_\alpha$ slightly for $\alpha \in A_E$, we may assume that they are precompact in $M$ and still form an open cover of $E$.
Then $K := \bigcup_{\alpha \in A_E} \overline{U_\alpha}$ is compact, so by Prohorov's theorem \cite[Theorem 13.29]{klenke2013probability}, there is a subsequence of $(T_{\mu_n})$ which converges to some $T_\mu|_K$ on $K$.
Moreover, by the portmanteau theorem,
$$\supp T_\mu|_K \subseteq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \supp T_{\mu_n}|_K \subseteq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \supp \lambda_n \cap K.$$
Here the $(\lambda_n)$ in the limit inferior refers to the subsequence which already converges in the Thurston topology (and has converging Ruelle-Sullivan currents).
In particular, the limit inferior is actually a limit and we conclude
$$\supp T_\mu|_K \subseteq \supp \lambda \cap K.$$
We may assume that $\mu_\alpha^n \to \mu_\alpha$ weakly for every $\alpha \in A_E$ and some positive Radon measures $\mu_\alpha$ (whose support is necessarily then contained in $K_\alpha$).
Moreover, $F^n_\alpha \to F_\alpha$ in $C^{1-}$ and $F^n_\alpha$ is bounded in tangential $C^\infty$, so $F_\alpha$ is tangentially $C^\infty$ by interpolation of H\"older spaces, and hence we have the convergence of pullbacks $(F^n_\alpha)^* \to F_\alpha^*$ in $C^0$ for any compactly supported $d-1$-form $\varphi$ on $U_\alpha$.
Taking the limit as $n \to \infty$ of the equation 
$$\int_{U_\alpha} T_{\mu_n} \wedge \varphi = \int_I \int_{\{k\} \times J} (F_\alpha^n)^* \varphi \dif \mu_\alpha^n(k),$$
we conclude that
$$\int_{U_\alpha} T_\mu|_K \wedge \varphi = \int_I \int_{\{k\} \times J} F_\alpha^* \varphi \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
In other words, $T_\mu|_K$ is Ruelle-Sullivan for $\lambda|_K$, possibly after shrinking $\lambda|_K$ so that their supports match.
By the measure-preserving condition in the definition of transverse measure, $T_\mu|_K$ extends uniquely to a Ruelle-Sullivan current $T_\mu$ on all of $M$, which then necessarily is a weak limit of $(T_{\mu_n})$.
This completes the proof of Theorem \ref{compactness theorem}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Measured convergence implies flow box convergence}
In order to show that convergence in the weak topology of measures implies convergence in the $C^{1-}$ flow box topology, we first show a weaker mode of convergence, namely Thurston's geometric topology.
Thurston claimed this fact \cite[Proposition 8.10.3]{thurston1979geometry} in case $d = 2$, but he did not justify why the limit is geodesic, or why the convergence respects the normal vectors.

\begin{lemma}\label{limits of measured geodesic lams are geodesic}
	The set of minimal measured laminations is closed in the weak topology of measures.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $(\lambda, \mu)$ be a measured lamination and suppose that $(\lambda_i, \mu_i) \to (\lambda, \mu)$ in the weak topology of measures, where $(\lambda_i, \mu_i)$ are measured minimal.
Let $x \in \supp \lambda$ and $r > 0$ such that $B := B(x, r)$ is contractible.
In $B$, we can write $T_{\mu_i} = \dif u_i$ for some sequence of functions of least gradient $u_i \in BV(B)$.
Since $u_i$ is only defined up to a constant, we impose $\int_M \star u_i = 0$, so by Poincar\'e's inequality,
$$\|u_i\|_{L^1(B)} \lesssim r\mu_i(B) \leq 2r \mu(B) < \infty$$
for $i$ large.
So by the Miranda stability theorem, there exists a $1$-harmonic function $u$ such that along a subsequence, $\dif u_i \to \dif u$ in the weak topology of measures.
But then we must have $T = \dif u$, so $\lambda$ is minimal by Theorem \ref{main thm of old paper}.
\end{proof}

We are now ready to prove Theorem \ref{implication theorem}.
So let $(\lambda_n, \mu_n)$ be a sequence of measured minimal laminations convering to $(\lambda, \mu)$.
Then
\begin{equation}\label{support is nonincreasing}
	\supp \lambda \subseteq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \supp \lambda_n.
\end{equation}
Indeed, if $x \in \supp \lambda$ then for all $\varepsilon > 0$, $\mu(B(x, \varepsilon)) > 0$.
Then by the portmanteau theorem, for all $n$ large, $\mu_n(B(x, \varepsilon)) > 0$; this proves (\ref{support is nonincreasing}).

By (\ref{support is nonincreasing}), for every $x \in \supp \lambda$, $\varepsilon > 0$, and large $n$, $\supp \lambda_n \cap B(x, \varepsilon)$ is nonempty, and by Lemma \ref{limits of measured geodesic lams are geodesic}, $\lambda$ is a minimal lamination.
By Proposition \ref{regularity theorem}, $\lambda, \lambda_n$ admit Lipschitz normal vectors, so by Lemma \ref{convergence of normals}, $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ in Thurston's geometric topology.

Now suppose that $(\lambda_n)$ has bounded curvature.
After discarding some leaves of $\lambda_n$ we may assume that $\lambda$ is a maximal limit.
Moreover, every subsequence $(\lambda_{n_k})$ has a further subsequence $(\lambda_{n_{k_\ell}})$ which converges to some maximal limit $\tilde \lambda$ in the $C^{1-}$ flow box topology by Theorem \ref{compactness theorem}.
But convergence in the flow box topology implies convergence in Thurston's topology, so $\tilde \lambda = \lambda$.
Since $(\lambda_{n_k})$ was arbitrary, it follows that $\lambda_n \to \lambda$ in the $C^{1-}$ flow box topology.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Application to 1-harmonic functions}
We finally prove Theorem \ref{main thm}.
We assume that $d \in \{2, 3, 4\}$.

Let $u$ be a $1$-harmonic function on $M$.
By Theorem \ref{main thm of old paper}, the level sets of $u$ are closed embedded minimal hypersurfaces in $M$; let
$$Y = \{y \in \RR: \partial \{u > y\} \neq \emptyset\}$$
index the level sets of $u$.

Let $y, z \in Y$. If $y > z$, then $\{u > y\} \subseteq \{u > z\}$, so $\partial \{u > y\}$ lies on one side of $\partial \{u > z\}$.
By the maximum principle for minimal surfaces \cite[Corollary 1.28]{colding2011course}, it follows that either $\partial \{u > y\}$ and $\partial \{u > z\}$ are disjoint, or are equal.
Moreover, $\dif u$ is conormal to $\partial \{u > y\}$, so $\partial \{u > y\}$ has trivial normal bundle.
Therefore by the stable Bernstein theorem, after replacing $M$ with an element of a compact exhaustion $(X_m)$ of $M$, we may assume that for some $A > 0$,
\begin{equation}\label{curvature estimate on 1 harmonic}
	\sup_{y \in Y} \|\Two_{\partial \{u > y\}}\|_{C^0} \leq A.
\end{equation}
We then choose a dense sequence $(y_n)$ in $Y$ and let $N_n = \partial \{u > y_n\}$.
Since $N_n$ is closed, $S_n := \bigcup_{k < n} N_k$ is also closed, so $S_n$ is the support of a minimal lamination $\lambda_n$.
By (\ref{curvature estimate on 1 harmonic}) and Theorem \ref{compactness theorem}, after passing to a subsequence we may find a limit $\lambda$ of $(\lambda_n)$ in the $C^{1-}$ flow box topology.
Diagonalizing against the compact exhaustion $(X_m)$, we can return to the original manifold $M$.

Every $N_n$ is a leaf of $\lambda$, and if $y \in Y$, then $\partial \{u > y\}$ is approximated by some subsequence of $(N_n)$ and so also is a leaf of $\lambda$.
Since this property characterizes leaves of $\lambda$, we conclude that the leaves of $\lambda$ are exactly the level sets of $u$.
It follows that $\bigcup_{y \in Y} \partial \{u > y\}$ is the support of $\lambda$, that $\lambda$ is minimal, and that $\dif u$ is conormal to $\lambda$.
In particular, we obtain an orientation on $\lambda$ from $\dif u$.

We now construct the transverse measure to $\lambda$.
In any oriented laminar coordinates $(k, x) \in K \times J$ for $\lambda$, $\partial_x u = 0$, so $\star |\dif u|$ defines a measure $\mu$ on $K$: given $\alpha < \beta$, let
$$\mu([\alpha, \beta] \cap K) := u(\beta, x) - u(\alpha, x)$$
for any (and hence every, since $\partial_x u = 0$) $x \in J$.
Since $(k, x)$ are oriented laminar coordinates, $u(\cdot, x)$ is nondecreasing, so $\mu$ is a positive measure.

If $(k', x') \in K' \times J$ is a different laminar coordinate system, and the transition map carries $\alpha, \beta$ to $\alpha', \beta'$, then
$$\mu'([\alpha', \beta'] \cap K') := u'(\beta', x') - u(\alpha', x') = u(\beta, x_1) - u(\alpha, x_2)$$
for some $x_1, x_2 \in J$. Since $\partial_x u = 0$,
$$u(\beta, x_1) - u(\alpha, x_2) = u(\beta, x_1) - u(\alpha, x_1) = \mu([\alpha, \beta] \cap K).$$
It follows that $\mu$ is transverse, and by construction $\mu$ lifts to $\star |\dif u|$ in $M$.
Therefore $\dif u = \normal_\lambda |\dif u|$ is the Ruelle-Sullivan current for the measured oriented structure we just imposed on $\lambda$.

For the converse, we assume that we are given a measured oriented minimal lamination $\lambda$, which then has a Ruelle-Sullivan current $T$.
Since $\dif T = 0$, we may assume, possibly after replacing $M$ with its universal cover, that $T$ is exact, say $T = \dif u$, and we just need to show that $u$ is $1$-harmonic.
If this is not true, then we can choose an open set $E \subseteq M$ with $C^\infty$ boundary and a function $v \in BV_\cpt(E)$ such that
$$\int_E \star |\dif u + \dif v| < \int_E \star |\dif u| < \infty.$$
Since $v$ has compact support, there exists a collar neighborhood $F \subseteq E$ of $\partial E$ such that for every $y \in \RR$,
$$\partial \{u > y\} \cap F = \partial^* \{u + v > y\} \cap F.$$
But by Theorem \ref{main thm of old paper}, the level sets $\partial \{u > y\}$ are stable minimal, so it follows that
$$|\partial \{u > y\} \cap E| \leq |\partial^* \{u + v > y\} \cap E|.$$
So by the coarea formula (see \todo{\cite{BackusFLG}} for a proof at this regularity),
\begin{align*}
\int_E \star |\dif u| &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\partial \{u > y\} \cap E| \dif y \leq \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\partial^* \{u + v > y\} \cap E| \dif y \\
&= \int_E \star |\dif u + \dif v| < \int_E \star |\dif u|
\end{align*}
which is a contradiction.

\appendix \section{Transverse cocycles}\label{transverse curves}
In this appendix, we show that convergence in the weak topology of measures as we have stated it (that is, the weak topology on the space of Ruelle-Sullivan currents) is equivalent to the formulation of Thurston \cite[\S8.6]{thurston1979geometry} that is more familiar to geometric topologists.

We shall loosely follow \cite[\S7.2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Let $\lambda$ be an oriented minimal lamination.
By Proposition \ref{regularity theorem}, $\lambda$ has a global Lipschitz normal vector field $\normal_\lambda$ and is tangentially $C^\infty$.
We shall assume that $\supp \lambda$ is a Lebesgue null set.
This assumption is harmless, because in the application of interest to geometric topologists, $M$ is a closed hyperbolic surface, and then by the Gauss-Bonnet formula it is indeed true that $\supp \lambda$ is null \cite[\S8.5]{thurston1998minimal}.

A curve $\gamma: I \to M$ is said to be \dfn{positively transverse} to $\lambda$ if $\langle \gamma', \normal_\lambda \rangle > 0$ on $\supp \lambda$; by taking pushforwards by the inverse of a laminar flow box, this is equivalent to the condition of \cite[Definition 7.7]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
We define negatively transverse curves similarly.
The transverse curve $\gamma$ is \dfn{admissibly transverse} if, in addition, the endpoints of $\gamma$ lie in $M \setminus \supp \lambda$.

% A sum of admissibly transverse curves is known as a \dfn{transverse $1$-chain}.
% We write $C_1(M, \lambda)$ for the group of transverse $1$-chains, modulo transverse homotopies to $\lambda$.
% A \dfn{transverse $1$-cocycle} is a representation $C_1(M, \lambda) \to \RR$ \cite[Definition 7.12]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.

% If $\mu$ is a transverse measure, then we can define a transverse $1$-cocycle, which we also denote by $\mu$, as follows.
% By subdividing $\gamma \in C_1(M, \lambda)$, we may assume that $\gamma$ is a positively transverse curve in the image $U_\alpha$ of a flow box $F_\alpha$.
% The projection of $(F_\alpha^{-1})_* \gamma$ to $I \subset K_\alpha$ is strictly increasing since $\gamma$ is positively transverse, so $\mu_\alpha$ induces a measure $\tilde \mu$ on $\gamma(I)$. We then define
% \begin{equation}\label{definition of cocycle}
% 	\mu(\gamma) := \int_{\gamma(I)} \langle \gamma', \normal_\lambda \rangle \dif \tilde \mu.
% \end{equation}
% This formula defines a positively transverse cocycle, and every positively transverse cocycle arises in this way; these facts are easy modifications of the discussion in \cite[\S7.2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.

If $\gamma: I \to M$ is an admissibly transverse curve, and $\mu$ is a transverse measure, then we define a measure $\gamma^! \mu$, the \dfn{exceptional pullback}\footnote{One can only push forward measures in general.} of $\mu$, on $I$.
First, we may assume that $\gamma$ is an alternating sum of admissibly positively transverse curves, and then by restricting to any such summand we may assume that $\gamma$ is admissibly positively transverse.
Such alternating sums are known as \dfn{good subdivisions} and constructed in \cite[Lemma 7.9]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.

If $\gamma$ is positively admissibly transverse, we consider all decompositions $\gamma = \sum_i \gamma_i$ where $\gamma_i$ is positively admissibly transverse and has domain $I_i = [t_i, t_{i + 1}] \subseteq I$.
Then, in a neighborhood of $\gamma_i$, $T_\mu$ is exact, say $T_\mu = \dif u$. Then we may set 
$$\gamma^! \mu(I_i) := u(\gamma(t_{i + 1})) - u(\gamma(t_i)).$$
Since $\supp \lambda$ is Lebesgue null, the set of $t$ such that $u(\gamma(t))$ is ill-defined is also Lebesgue null, and $u$ is a nondecreasing function since $\gamma$ is positively admissibly transverse.
So $\gamma^! \mu$ is a well-defined Radon measure on $I$ whose (distributional) Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative is $\dif(\gamma^* u)$ (which itself is well-defined since $u$ is nondecreasing and hence $BV(I)$).
We define $\gamma^! \mu$ for inadmissible transverse curves $\gamma$ by extending $\gamma$ slightly to a transverse curve and then taking intersections over extensions and applying continuity from above.

Taking exceptional pullbacks, we see that we may view $\mu$ as the data of a Radon measure on every transverse curve satisfying a compatibility condition; this is the definition of transverse measure which appears in the definition of measure convergence in \cite[\S8.6]{thurston1979geometry}.


\begin{proposition}\label{characterization of measure convergence}
	Let $(\lambda_n, \mu_n)$ and $(\lambda, \mu)$ be oriented measured minimal laminations. Then $(\lambda_n, \mu_n) \to (\lambda, \mu)$ iff for every positively transverse curve $\gamma$ to $\lambda$ defined in a small neighborhood of $\supp \lambda$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\gamma$ is eventually positively transverse to $\lambda_n$, and 
\item $\gamma^! \mu_n \to \gamma^! \mu$ in the weak topology of measures.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	First assume that $(\lambda_n, \mu_n) \to (\lambda, \mu)$ and $\gamma$ is positively transverse to $\lambda$.
	By Lemma \ref{convergence of normals}, in a neighborhood of $\supp \lambda$, we have $\langle \normal_{\lambda_n}, \gamma' \rangle > 0$ for $n$ large, where $n$ can be chosen uniformly on $M$ since the image of $\gamma$ is compact. So $\gamma$ is eventually positively transverse to $\lambda_n$.

	By working locally we may assume that $T_\mu = \dif u$ and $T_{\mu_n} = \dif u_n$, and by possibly extending $\gamma$ if necessary we may assume that it is admissibly transverse.
	Since $\dif u_n \to \dif u$ in the weak topology of measures, the portmanteau theorem implies that for any curve $\rho$ from $x$ to $y$ such that $u$ is continuous near $x, y$, $u_n(y) - u_n(x) \to u(y) - u(x)$.
	Taking $\rho$ to range over admissible subcurves of $\gamma$, and applying the portmanteau theorem again, we conclude that $\dif(\gamma^* u_n) \to \dif(\gamma^* u)$ and hence $\gamma^! \mu_n \to \gamma^! \mu$.

	Conversely, if $\gamma^! \mu_n \to \gamma^! \mu$ for every positively transverse $\gamma$, then by the existence of flow box coordinates for $\lambda$ (given by Proposition \ref{regularity theorem}), we can actually foliate a neighborhood of any point $x$ of $\supp \lambda$ by admissibly positively transverse curves.
	These curves depend continuously on their intersection point with the leaf of $\supp \lambda$ containing $x$, so the fact that one of them is positively transverse to $\lambda_n$ for $n \geq N/2$ and some even integer $N$ implies that in a neighborhood of $x$, every curve in the foliation is positively transverse to $\lambda_n$ for $n \geq N$.
	Let $J$ be the set of such curves, equipped with the measure $\nu$ obtained by disintegrating the Riemannian measure into arc length measures $s_\gamma$ on each $\gamma$.
	
	If $\varphi$ is a continuous $d-1$-form with support near $x$, we may define the restriction $f_\gamma$ of $\varphi \wedge (\gamma')^\flat$ to $\gamma$.
	By the disintegration theorem,
	$$\int_M T_\mu \wedge \varphi = \int_J \int_I f_\gamma \frac{\dif(\gamma^! \mu)}{\dif s_\gamma} \dif s_\gamma \dif \nu(\gamma) = \int_J \int_I f_\gamma \dif(\gamma^! \mu) \dif \nu(\gamma).$$
	One can show using the dominated convergence theorem and the fact that $\gamma^! \mu_n \to \gamma^! \mu$ weakly that 
	$$\int_M T_\mu \wedge \varphi = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_J \int_I f_\gamma \dif(\gamma^! \mu_n) \dif \nu(\gamma) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_M T_{\mu_n} \wedge \varphi$$
	but since $\varphi$ is arbitrary, it holds that $T_{\mu_n} \to T_\mu$ in the weak topology of measures.
\end{proof}
