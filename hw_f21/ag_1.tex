\begin{exer}[1.10]
Let $\mathscr F = (\mathscr F_i)$ be a direct system of sheaves on $X$.
Show that the direct limit $\varinjlim \mathscr F_i$ of the system in the category of sheaves is the sheafification of $\varinjlim \mathscr F_i(\bullet)$.
\end{exer}

Let $\mathscr G$ be the presheaf $\varinjlim \mathscr F_i(\bullet)$ and
$$\alpha: \mathscr G \to \mathscr G^+$$
its sheafification.
By the universal property of $\mathscr G(U)$, $\varphi_i(U)$ factors through the direct limit map $\psi_i(U): \mathscr F_i(U) \to \mathscr G(U)$.

We now claim that the direct limit maps $\psi_i(U)$ are compatible with restriction.
In fact, if $V \subseteq U$ then the restriction map $\mathscr G(U) \to \mathscr G(V)$ is the direct limit of the directed system of restriction maps $\mathscr F_i(U) \to \mathscr F_i(V)$, and by definition of a direct system of sheaves, the restriction maps $\mathscr F_i(U) \to \mathscr F_i(V)$ are compatible with the maps $\psi_{ij}(U): \mathscr F_i(U) \to \mathscr F_j(U)$.
Therefore $\mathscr G(U) \to \mathscr G(V)$ is also compatible with $\psi_i(U)$.

So we have morphisms of presheaves
$$\psi_i: \mathscr F_i \to \mathscr G$$
which are compatible with the direct system structure of $\mathscr F$.
If we have morphisms of sheaves $\varphi_i: \mathscr F_i \to \mathscr H$ which are compatible with the direct system structure of $\mathscr F$, then we have morphisms of abelian groups
$$\varphi_i(U): \mathscr F_i(U) \to \mathscr H(U)$$
which are compatible with the direct system structure of $\mathscr F(U) = (\mathscr F_i(U))$.
So by the universal property of $\mathscr G(U)$, we can take the limit of the maps $\varphi_i(U)$ to get maps
$$\delta(U): \mathscr G(U) \to \mathscr H(U)$$
with
$$\varphi_i(U) = \delta_i(U) \circ \psi_i(U).$$
Since $\delta(U)$ are the limits of maps which are at once compatible with the direct system structure of $\mathscr F$ and the presheaf structure of $\mathscr F_i$, they in fact define a morphism of presheaves
$$\delta: \mathscr G \to \mathscr H.$$
Applying the universal property of $\alpha$ now gives us a morphism of sheaves $\delta^+: \mathscr G^+ \to \mathscr H$ such that
$$\varphi_i = \delta^+ \circ \alpha \circ \psi_i.$$
Therefore $\mathscr G^+$ is initial among sheaves which the direct system of sheaves $\mathscr F$ maps to, which is the desired universal property.

\begin{exer}[1.14]
Let $\mathscr F$ be a sheaf, and let $s \in \mathscr F(U)$.
Show that $\supp s$ is a closed subset of $U$.
\end{exer}

Let $V$ be the set of $x \in U$ such that $s_x = 0$.
Then for every $x \in V$, there is an open neighborhood $W_x \subseteq U$ such that $s|W_x = 0$ and hence $W_x \subseteq V$.
So $V = \bigcup_{x \in V} W_x$ is open in $U$ and hence its complement, $\supp s$, is closed.

\begin{exer}[2.3a]
Show that $X$ is a reduced scheme iff for every $x \in X$, $\Olo_{X, x}$ has no nilpotent elements.
\end{exer}

Suppose that there is $x \in X$ such that $\Olo_{X, x}$ has a nonzero germ $f$ such that there exists $n \geq 2$ with $f^n = 0$.
Then we can extend $f$ to a representative $f$ defined on an open set $U$ such that $f^n = 0$.
So $U$ witnesses that $X$ is nonreduced.

Conversely, if for every $x \in X$, $\Olo_{X, x}$ has no nilpotent germs, suppose that $f \in \Olo_X(U)$ satisfies $f^n = 0$.
Then the germ $(f_x)^n = 0$ so $f_x = 0$.
Since $f$ always localizes to $0$, $f = 0$, so $X$ is reduced.

\begin{exer}[2.3b]
If $A$ is a ring, we define its reduction $A_{red}$ to be the quotient of $A$ by the nilradical of $A$.
Let $X$ be a scheme and let $\Olo_{X;red}$ be the sheafification of $\Olo_X(\bullet)_{red}$.
Show that $X_{red} = (X, \Olo_{X;red})$ is a scheme and there is a morphism of schemes $X_{red} \to X$ which is a homeomorphism.
\end{exer}

Throughout this problem, if $\mathscr F$ is a presheaf of rings, we define its nilradical $\mathscr N$ to be the presheaf of abelian groups defined by setting $\mathscr N(U)$ to be the nilradical of $\mathscr F(U)$.

By definition, $X_{red}$ is a ringed space.
Moreover, by construction for every open set $U$, we have the reduction map
$$\psi(U): \Olo_X(U) \to \Olo_X(U)_{red}.$$
Then $\psi$ is the quotient map of $\Olo_X$ by its nilradical, so $\psi$ is a morphism of presheaves.
Composing $\psi$ with the sheafification map $\Olo_X(U)_{red} \to \Olo_{X;red}$ defines a morphism of sheaves
$$\varphi: \Olo_X \to \Olo_{X;red}.$$
We define $f: X_{red} \to X$ to be the identity on points and $f^\sharp = \varphi$, so $f = (f, f^\sharp)$ is a morphism of ringed spaces.

We now claim that $X_{red}$ is locally ringed and $f$ is a morphism of locally ringed spaces.
Let $x \in X_{red}$.
Since $\varphi$ is the sheafification of $\psi$, $\psi$ is the quotient map by the nilradical $\mathscr N$ of $\Olo_X$, and sheafification is the identity on stalks,
$$(\Olo_{X;red})_x = \frac{\Olo_{X, x}}{\mathscr N_x} = (\Olo_{X, x})_{red}.$$
Here we used the fact that the direct limit of quotients $\Olo_X(U)/\mathscr N(U)$ is a quotient $\Olo_{X,x}/\mathscr N_x$.
In any case, the reduction of a local ring is a quotient map of local rings, i.e. is a morphism of local rings.
Therefore $(\Olo_{X;red})_x$ is a local ring and
$$\varphi_x: \Olo_{X, x} \to (\Olo_{X;red})_x$$
is a morphism of local rings.
Therefore $X_{red}$ is a locally ringed space and $f$ is a morphism of locally ringed spaces.

Now we claim that $X_{red}$ is a scheme and $f$ is a morphism of schemes.
To check this, we fix an open cover $\mathcal U$ of $X$ by affine schemes.
Then for every $U \in \mathcal U$, say $U = \Spec A$, we obtain
$$f^{-1}(U) = f^{-1}(\Spec A) = \Spec(\varphi(U)(A)) \Spec(A_{red}),$$
so $f^{-1}(U)$ is an affine scheme.
Since $f$ is the identity by points, the pullback of $\mathcal U$ by $f$ is therefore an open cover of $X_{red}$ by affine schemes, so the claim holds.

Finally, since $f$ is the identity on points, $f$ is obviously a homeomorphism.

\begin{exer}[2.3c]
Let $Y$ be a scheme.
Show that $Y_{red}$ is final among reduced schemes over $Y$.
\end{exer}

Let $f: X \to Y$ be a reduced scheme over $Y$.
Then on the level of topological spaces, $f$ factors through the identity map on $Y$ and hence on the map $Y_{red} \to Y$.
We just need to show that the pullback $f^\sharp: \Olo_Y \to \Olo_X$ factors through the reduction map $\Olo_Y \to \Olo_{Y;red}$ in the category of sheaves, but by the universal property of sheafification, that is equivalent to $f^\sharp$ factoring through the reduction map
$$\psi: \Olo_Y \to \Olo_Y(\bullet)_{red}$$
in the category of \emph{pre}sheaves.
But $\psi$ is a quotient map so this just means that $f^\sharp$ vanishes on the nilradical $\mathscr N$ of $\Olo_Y$ and hence drops to a morphism of presheaves
$$\varphi: \frac{\Olo_Y}{\mathscr N} = \Olo_Y(\bullet)_{red} \to \Olo_X.$$
Now let $f^\sharp_{red}: \Olo_{Y;red} \to X$ be the sheafification of $\varphi$.
Then $f_{red} = (f, f^\sharp_{red})$ is a morphism of schemes $X \to Y_{red}$ which witnesses that $Y_{red}$ is final.

\begin{exer}[2.5]
Describe $\Spec \ZZ$ and show that it is final among schemes.
\end{exer}

Points of $\Spec \ZZ$ are either prime numbers or the trivial ideal $\xi$.
If $p$ is prime then we can view $p$ as both a function on $\Spec \ZZ$ and a point of $\Spec \ZZ$; using this duality, $p(p) = 0$ while $p(q)$ is nonzero for any $\Spec \ZZ \setminus p$, thus $\Spec \ZZ \setminus p$ is open and hence $\{p\}$ is a closed point.
On the other hand, if $f$ is a function on $\Spec \ZZ$ such that $f(\xi) = 0$, then $f$ is an integer which is $0$ modulo $0$ and hence $f = 0$ identically; so there are no functions which only vanish on $\xi$ and hence $\xi$ lies in every nonempty open subset of $\Spec \ZZ$.
The sets $\{n: n \neq p\}$ where $p$ is a prime number are thus a basis for the topology of $\Spec \ZZ$.
The open set $U = \{n: n \neq p\}$ has as its ring $\Olo_\ZZ(U)$ the localization of $\ZZ$ to $U$, thus it consists of those fractions without a factor of $p$ in the denominator.
I think we're supposed to imagine $\Spec \ZZ$ as a fiber bundle, with base space the space of prime numbers, and the fiber of the prime number $p$ is the field $\ZZ/p$.

Since $\Spec \ZZ$ is an affine scheme, we have a natural bijection
$$\Hom(X, \Spec \ZZ) \to \Hom(\ZZ, \Olo_X(X))$$
and since $\Olo_X(X)$ is a ring and $\ZZ$ is initial among rings, there is a unique morphism of rings $\ZZ \to \Olo_X(X)$, hence a unique morphism $X \to \Spec \ZZ$.
Therefore $\Spec \ZZ$ is final.

\begin{exer}[3.1]
Show that a morphism $f: X \to Y$ is locally of finite type iff for every affine open subset $V = \Spec B$ of $Y$, $f^{-1}(V)$ can be covered by affine open subsets $U_j = \Spec A_j$ where $A_j$ is a finitely generated $B$-algebra.
\end{exer}

One direction is obvious from the definition of ``locally of finite type" and the fact that $Y$ has an open cover by affine open sets.
To prove the converse, suppose that $f$ is locally of finite type and $V = \Spec B$ is an affine open subset of $Y$.
To save ourselves a lot of words, we let $\mathcal P$ be the set of all rings $P$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Spec P$ is an affine open subset of $Y$.
\item $f^{-1}(\Spec P)$ admits an open cover by spectra of finitely generated $P$-algebras.
\end{enumerate}
We must show that $B \in \mathcal P$.

We first show that $\mathcal P$ is closed under localization.
For every $P \in \mathcal P$ there is a set $\mathcal Q(P)$ of finitely generated $P$-algebras such that $f^{-1}(\Spec P)$ is covered by $\{\Spec Q: Q \in \mathcal Q(P)\}$.
In particular for every $Q$ we can find a morphism of rings $\varphi_{PQ}: P[x_1, \dots, x_n] \to Q$ which is surjective.
Let $S \subset P$ be a multiplicative set.
Elements of $Q[S^{-1}]$ are formal fractions $\varphi_{PQ}(F(x_1, \dots, x_n))/\varphi_{PQ}(s)$ with $s \in S$ and $F(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in P[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ such that for every $t \in S$, $F(x_1, \dots, x_n)t \neq 0$.
But
$$\frac{\varphi_{PQ}(F(x_1, \dots, x_n))}{\varphi_{PQ}(s)} = \varphi_{PQ}[S^{-1}]\left(\frac{F(x_1, \dots, x_n)}{s}\right)$$
so
$$\varphi_{PQ}[S^{-1}]: P[x_1, \dots, x_n, S^{-1}] \to Q[S^{-1}]$$
is surjective.
In particular $Q[S^{-1}]$ is a finitely generated $P[S^{-1}]$-algebra.
Since $f^{-1}(\Spec P[S^{-1}])$ is covered by $\{\Spec Q[S^{-1}]: Q \in \mathcal Q(P)\}$, it follows that $P[S^{-1}] \in \mathcal P$, as desired.

Now suppose that $P$ is a ring with elements $p_1, \dots, p_n \in P$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Spec P$ is an affine open subset of $Y$.
\item $p_1, \dots, p_n$ generate the unit ideal of $P$.
\item For every $i \in I = \{1, \dots, k\}$, $P[{p_i}^{-1}] \in \mathcal P$.
\end{enumerate}
We claim that $P \in \mathcal P$.
In fact for every $i \in I$ there exists an open cover $\mathcal U_i$ of $f^{-1}(\Spec P_i)$ by spectra of finitely generated $P_i$-algebras.
Let $\mathcal U = \bigcup_{i \in I} \mathcal U_i$, so $\mathcal U$ is a set of affine open subsets of $X$.
Since $p_1, \dots, p_n$ generate the unit ideal of $P$, $\{\Spec P_i: i \in I\}$ is an open cover of $\Spec P$, so $\mathcal U$ is an open cover of $f^{-1}(\Spec P)$.
So we just need to show that if $Q$ is a finitely generated $P_i$-algebra then $Q$ is a finitely generated $P$-algebra as well, but we have surjective maps
$$\begin{tikzcd}
P[x_0, \dots, x_n] \arrow[r,"\alpha"] & P_i[x_1, \dots, x_n] \arrow[r,"\beta"] & Q
\end{tikzcd}
$$
where $\alpha$ is defined by $\alpha(x_0) = p_i^{-1}$ and $\beta$ witnesses that $Q$ is finitely generated over $P_i$.
The composite $\beta \circ \alpha$ witnesses that $Q$ is finitely generated over $P$.

Finally, we show $B \in \mathcal P$.
By hypothesis there exists $\mathcal P_1 \subseteq \mathcal P$ such that $\{\Spec P: P \in \mathcal P_1\}$ is an open cover of $Y$.
Since $\Spec B$ is quasicompact, there exists a finite set $\mathcal P_2 \subseteq \mathcal P_1$ such that $\{\Spec P: P \in \mathcal P_2\}$ is an open cover of $\Spec B$.
Now for every $P \in \mathcal P_2$ we can find an open cover $\mathcal U(P)$ of $\Spec B \cap \Spec P$ (finite since $\Spec B \cap \Spec P$ is quasicompact) such that elements of $\mathcal U(P)$ are spectra of $B[{b_i}^{-1}] = P[S^{-1}]$ for some $S$ and $b_i$.
So every element of $\mathcal U(P)$ is the spectrum of an element of $\mathcal P$ since $\mathcal P$ is closed under localization.
Moreover, the covering property means that $b_1, \dots, b_\ell$ generate the unit ideal of $B$, and hence $B \in \mathcal P$.

\begin{exer}[3.6]
Let $X$ be an integral scheme with generic point $\xi$.
Show that $K(X) = \Olo_{X, \xi}$ is a field and for every open affine subset $\Spec A$ of $X$, $K(X)$ is the field of fractions of $A$.
\end{exer}

Since $\xi$ is a generic point, $\xi$ is an element of every nonempty open subset of $X$.
In particular, $\xi \in \Spec A$, so that $K(X) = \Olo_{\Spec A, \xi}$.
Therefore it is no loss to assume that $X$ itself is affine, say $X = \Spec A$, in which case we just need to show that $\Olo_{X, \xi}$ is the field of fractions of $X$.
But in that case, $\Olo_{X, \xi}$ is the localization of $A$ at its zero ideal, which is the field of fractions of $A$ by definition of field of fractions.
