\begin{abstract}
We study the behavior of $q$-harmonic functions and their $p$-harmonic conjugates in the limit as $q \to 1$, where $(p, q)$ is a H\"older conjugate pair.
The $1$-Laplacian is already known to give rise to laminations by minimal hypersurfaces; we show that the limiting $p$-harmonic conjugates converge to calibrations $F$ of the laminations.
Moreover, we show that the laminations which are calibrated by $F$ are exactly those which arise from the $1$-Laplacian.

We also explore the limiting dual problem as a model problem in the $L^\infty$ calculus of variations.
We show that under an integrability condition, smooth solutions of the dual variational problem are equivalent to smooth solutions of a PDE which generalizes the $\infty$-Laplacian.
But we show that in the nonintegrable case, there exist smooth solutions of the PDE which are not minimizers.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
Let $M$ be a closed surface of genus $\gamma \geq 2$.
Thurston introduced a Finsler metric on the Teichm\"uller space $\mathscr T_\gamma$ of hyperbolic structures on $M$.
Let $\rho, \sigma$ be two hyperbolic structures on $M$. 
Let $f: M \to M$ minimize its Lipschitz constant
$$\Lip(f) := \sup_{\substack{x, y \in M \\ x \neq y}} \frac{\dist_{(M, \rho)}(f(x), f(y))}{\dist_{(M, \sigma)}(x, y)}$$
among all maps homotopic to $\id_M$, and let $L(\rho, \sigma) := \Lip(f)$.
Then the \dfn{Thurston metric} on $\mathscr T_\gamma$ is $\log L$.

The Thurston metric is a Finsler metric on $\mathscr T_\gamma$ \cite{Papadopoulos15}, and is intimately related to the structure of the geodesic laminations on $M$.
Let $\lambda$ be a geodesic lamination on $(M, \rho)$.
Then $\lambda$ can be deformed to a geodesic lamination on $(M, \sigma)$; the deformation will stretch each leaf of $\lambda$ by some factor which we call the \dfn{stretch ratio} of $\lambda$.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite{Thurston98}}]\label{Thurston MFMC}
Let $\rho, \sigma$ be two hyperbolic structures on the closed surface $M$, and let $K(\rho, \sigma)$ be the supremum of the stretch ratios of all geodesic laminations on $(M, \rho)$.
Then 
\begin{equation}\label{Thurston MFMC formula}
L(\rho, \sigma) = K(\rho, \sigma).
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Thurston's proof of Theorem \ref{Thurston MFMC} is a \emph{tour de force} of geometric topology, but he conjectured that there should be an easier and more general proof \cite[Abstract]{Thurston98}:

\begin{quote}
I currently think that a characterization of minimal stretch maps should be possible in a considerably more general context (in particular, to include some version for all Riemannian surfaces), and it should be feasible with a simpler proof based on more general principles -- in particular, the max flow min cut principle, convexity, and $L^0 \leftrightarrow L^\infty$ duality. \dots
I also expect that this theory fits into a context including $L^p$ comparisons \dots. 
\end{quote}

This conjecture has recently been proven by Daskalopolous and Uhlenbeck \cite{daskalopoulos2022,daskalopoulos2023,uhlenbeck2023noether}.
For our purposes, the salient parts of the proof can already been seen in the toy problem of extremal Lipschitz maps with values in $\Sph^1$ \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic surface, let $\rho \in H^1(M, \ZZ)$, and let $u: M \to \Sph^1$ be a viscosity solution of the \dfn{$\infty$-Laplacian}
\begin{equation}\label{infinity laplacian}\begin{cases}
\langle \nabla^2 u, \dif u \otimes \dif u\rangle = 0, \\
[\dif u] = \rho.
\end{cases}\end{equation}
Then $u$ minimizes $\Lip(u) = \|\dif u\|_{L^\infty}$ among all maps representing $\rho$, and $u$ is approximated by solutions of the $p$-Laplacian in the limit $p \to \infty$.
The convex dual problem to the $p$-Laplacian on a surface is the $q$-Laplacian, where $1/p + 1/q = 1$, and the solution $v_q$ of the dual problem converges to a function of least gradient $v$ -- that is, $v$ minimizes $\int_M \star |\dif v|$.
The analogue of (\ref{Thurston MFMC formula}) follows from their main theorem:

\begin{theorem}[{\cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse}}]\label{Daskalopolous MFMC}
Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic surface, let $\rho \in H^1(M, \ZZ)$, and let $u$ solve (\ref{infinity laplacian}) with dual function of least gradient $v$.
Then there is a geodesic lamination $\lambda$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $|\dif u|$ attains its maximum on $\lambda$.
\item $\dif v$ is a Ruelle-Sullivan current\footnote{We refer the reader to \S\ref{lamination intro sec} for the definition of a Ruelle-Sullivan current.} for $\lambda$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

In Theorem \ref{Daskalopolous MFMC}, after normalizing $\Lip(u) = 1$, one can think of $\dif u$ as a calibration\footnote{We refer the reader to \S\ref{calibration intro sec} for the definition of a calibration.} which calibrates the leaves of $\lambda$.
This theorem fits into a circle of general results suggesting a general duality theorem, where on one side we have calibrations arising from an $L^\infty$ variational problem, and on the other side we have Ruelle-Sullivan currents arising from functions of least gradient.
I showed that every function $u$ of least gradient induces a Ruelle-Sullivan current $\dif u$ for the lamination of area-minimizing hypersurfaces whose leaves are the level sets of $u$ \cite{BackusCML}.
Maz\'on, Rossi, and Segura de L\'eon showed that every function of least gradient is dual to a calibration \cite{Mazon14}.
Finally, we have a theorem of Bangert and Cui; to state it, we define for a cohomology class $\rho \in H^{d - 1}_{\rm dR}(M, \RR)$ its \dfn{costable norm}
$$\Comass(\rho) := \inf_{[F] = \rho} \|F\|_{L^\infty}.$$

\begin{theorem}[{\cite{bangert_cui_2017}}]\label{Bangert MFMC}
Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$.
Let $F$ be a continuous calibration $d - 1$-form on $M$ such that $\Comass([F]) = 1$.
Then there is a measured lamination $\lambda$ on $M$ such that $F$ calibrates the leaves of $\lambda$.
\end{theorem}

In this paper, we shall unify Theorems \ref{Daskalopolous MFMC} and \ref{Bangert MFMC}.
To state our main result informally, let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$, and let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ satisfy $\Comass(\rho) = 1$.
Then one can find a solution $F$ of a generalized $\infty$-Laplacian such that $[F] = \rho$ and $F$ calibrates the leaves of a measured lamination $\lambda$.
Furthermore, the solution of the convex dual problem is a function of least gradient $u$ such that $\dif u$ is a transverse measure to the leaves of $\lambda$, and we have an analogue of (\ref{Thurston MFMC formula}).
Finally, the calibration $F$ and the function of least gradient $u$ arises as limits of solutions of a generalized $p$-Laplacian, and of the $q$-Laplacian, respectively, as $p \to \infty$ (where $1/p + 1/q = 1$).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Review of calibrated geometry}\label{calibration intro sec}
Throughout this paper, let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $d \geq 2$.
Before stating our main results, we recall some terminology concerning currents and calibrations on $M$.
We refer the reader to \cite{Harvey82} for more details, and Appendix \ref{GMT appendix} for our conventions regarding currents.

The \dfn{comass} of a $k$-form $F$ is
$$\Comass(F) := \esssup_{x \in M} \sup_{v_1, \dots, v_k \in T_x M} \frac{\langle F, v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k\rangle}{|v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k|}.$$
If $k = d - 1$, then the comass is particularly easy to work with, as we have $\Comass(F) = \|F\|_{L^\infty}$.
Dually, the \dfn{mass} of a $k$-current $T$ is 
$$\Mass(T) := \sup_{\substack{F \in C^0(M, \Omega^k) \\ \Comass(F) \leq 1}} \int_M T \wedge F.$$
Notice that if $T$ represents a $k$-dimensional submanifold $N$, then $\Mass(T) = \vol(N)$.

If $\Comass(F) = 1$ and $\dif F = 0$, then $F$ is a \dfn{calibration}.
If $F$ is a calibration, then a $k$-dimensional submanifold $N \subseteq M$ is \dfn{$F$-calibrated} if $F$ pulls back to the Riemannian volume form on $N$.
We think of $F$ as a ``certificate'' of the minimality of $N$, as made precise by the \dfn{fundamental theorem of calibrated geometry} \cite{Harvey82}.

\begin{theorem}[fundamental theorem of calibrated geometry]
Let $F$ be a calibration $k$-form and $N$ a $F$-calibrated submanifold. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every $k + 1$-dimensional submanifold $P$, $\vol(N) \leq \vol(N + \partial P)$.
\item For every $k - 1$-form $A$, $\Comass(F) \leq \Comass(F + \dif A)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The proof is frequently useful to us, so we recall it briefly.
The bound on $\Comass(F)$ is similar, so we just consider the bound on $\vol(N)$.
By Stokes' theorem, $\int_{\partial P} F = 0$, so
$$\vol(N) = \int_N F = \int_{N + \partial P} F \leq \vol(N + \partial P).$$

The mass and comass induce norms on homology and cohomology.
The \dfn{costable norm} of $\rho \in H^k(M, \RR)$ is 
$$\Comass(\rho) := \inf_{[F] = \rho} \Comass(F),$$
and dually, the \dfn{stable norm} of $\alpha \in H_k(M, \RR)$ is 
$$\Mass(\alpha) := \inf_{[T] = \alpha} \Mass(T).$$
The stable norm was studied by Gromov \cite[Chapter 4]{gromov2007metric} though the idea goes back to Federer \cite{Federer1974}, who made use of the fact that the stable and costable norms are dual norms.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tight forms and least gradient functions}
Let $\tilde M \to M$ be the universal covering.
Let $1 < p < \infty$, $1/p + 1/q = 1$, and $\alpha \in H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
If a function $u: \tilde M \to \RR$ is equivariant under $\pi_1(M)$, then $\dif u$ drops to a closed $1$-form on $M$, and we write $[\dif u] = \alpha$ if $\alpha$ is Poincar\'e dual to the cohomology class of $\dif u$.
We shall be interested in the $q$-Laplacian
\begin{equation}\label{q harmonic}
\begin{cases}
\dif^*(|\dif u|^{q - 2} \dif u) = 0, \\
[\dif u] = \alpha
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
and its convex dual problem
\begin{equation}\label{p tight}
\begin{cases}
\dif F = 0, \\ 
\dif^*(|F|^{p - 2} F) = 0, \\
[F] = \rho.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here $F$ is a $d - 1$-form on $M$, $[F]$ is the cohomology class of $F$, and $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ is a class which depends on $\alpha$.
Recall that solutions of (\ref{q harmonic}) are called \dfn{$q$-harmonic}; we say that solutions of (\ref{p tight}) are \dfn{$p$-tight}.
If $\rho$ was chosen so that (\ref{q harmonic}) and (\ref{p tight}) are convex dual problems, then we have 
\begin{equation}\label{harmonic conjugate}
\dif u = (-1)^{d - 1} |F|^{p - 2} \star |F|
\end{equation}
and we say that $(F, u)$ is a \dfn{dual pair of a $p$-tight form and $q$-harmonic function}.

\begin{definition}
Let $u \in BV(\tilde M, \RR)$ be a $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant function.
Suppose that, for every $\pi_1(M)$-invariant function $v$,
$$\Mass(\dif u) \leq \Mass(\dif u + \dif v).$$
Then $u$ has \dfn{least gradient}.
\end{definition}

Our first theorem is a summary of Propositions \ref{existence infinity} and \ref{existence 1}, and describes the limiting behavior of the $p$-tight forms and their $q$-harmonic conjugates as $p \to \infty$.

\begin{mainthm}\label{existence of infinity tight forms}
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ be a nonzero cohomology class.
Let $(F_p, u_q)$ be the family of dual pairs of $p$-tight forms and $q$-harmonic functions, suitably normalized, with $[F_p] = \rho$, $1/p + 1/q = 1$, and $1 < p < \infty$.
Then there exists a pair $(F, u)$ such that as $p \to \infty$ along a subsequence, $F_p \weakto F$ in $L^r$ for any $1 \leq r < \infty$, and $u_q \weakto^* u$ in $BV$, such that
\begin{equation}\label{best comass}
\Comass(F) = \Comass(\rho),
\end{equation}
the product of distributions $\dif u \wedge F$ is well-defined,
\begin{equation}\label{max flow min cut}
\Comass(F) \star |\dif u| = \dif u \wedge F,
\end{equation}
and $u$ is a nonconstant function of least gradient.
\end{mainthm}

If a closed $d - 1$-form $F$ is a limit of $p$-tight forms $F_p$, as in Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms}, we say that $F$ is a \dfn{tight} form.
Thus the content of Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms} is that every cohomology class contains a tight form, every tight form minimizes its $L^\infty$ norm, and every tight form $F$ has a dual function $u$ of least gradient, in the sense that $(F, u)$ satisfies the relation (\ref{max flow min cut}).

Suppose that $\Comass(\rho) = 1$.
Then (\ref{best comass}) asserts that the tight form $F$ is a calibration, and (\ref{max flow min cut}) asserts that every level set of $u$ is $F$-calibrated.
Thus $F$ certificates the fact that $u$ has least gradient.
This allows us, in the proof of Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms}, to show that $u$ has least gradient without a careful analysis of the behavior of $u_q$ as $q \to 1$ which appeared in the previous works \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse,daskalopoulos2022}.

Though they did not use the language of calibrations, it is interesting to think of Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms} as a partial converse of the theorem of Maz\'on, Rossi, and Segura de L\'eon \cite{Mazon14}, which asserts that every least gradient function is certificated by a calibration.
In fact, one can show that their calibration is tight.
Their result holds for the Dirichlet problem, but as we show in \S\ref{boundaries bad}, the analogue of Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms} is false for the Dirichlet problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Calibrations of measured laminations}\label{lamination intro sec}
To give a more geometric interpretation of Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms}, we recall the language of laminations.
See \cite{BackusCML} for more details.

\begin{definition}
Let $I \subset \RR$ be an interval and $J \subset \RR^{d - 1}$ a box. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A (codimension-$1$, Lipschitz) \dfn{laminar flow box} is a Lipschitz coordinate chart $\Psi: I \times J \to M$ and a compact set $K \subseteq I$, called the \dfn{local leaf space}, such that for each $k \in K$, $\Psi|_{\{k\} \times J}$ is a $C^1$ embedding, and the leaf $\Psi(\{k\} \times J)$ is a $C^1$ complete hypersurface in $\Psi(I \times J)$.
\item Two laminar flow boxes belong to the same \dfn{laminar atlas} if the transition map preserves the local leaf spaces.
\item A \dfn{lamination} $\lambda$ is a closed nonempty set $\supp \lambda$ and a maximal laminar atlas $\{(\Psi_\alpha, K_\alpha): \alpha \in A\}$ such that
$$\supp \lambda \cap \Psi_\alpha(I \times J) = \Psi_\alpha(K_\alpha \times J).$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $\lambda$ be a lamination with laminar atlas $\{(\Psi_\alpha, K_\alpha): \alpha \in A\}$. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If every leaf of $\lambda$ has zero mean curvature, then $\lambda$ is \dfn{minimal}. If in addition $d = 2$, then $\lambda$ is \dfn{geodesic}.
\item Let $F$ be a calibration. If every leaf of $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated, then $\lambda$ is \dfn{$F$-calibrated}.
\item If the transition maps $\Psi_\alpha^{-1} \circ \Psi_\beta$ are orientation-preserving, then $\lambda$ is \dfn{oriented}.
\item A \dfn{transverse measure} $\mu$ to $\lambda$ consists of Radon measures $\mu_\alpha$ on each local leaf space $K_\alpha$, such that the transition maps $\Psi_\alpha^{-1} \circ \Psi_\beta$ send $\mu_\beta$ to $\mu_\alpha$, and $\supp \mu_\alpha = K_\alpha$.
The pair $(\lambda, \mu)$ is a \dfn{measured lamination}.
\item Suppose that $\lambda$ is measured oriented, and let $\{\chi_\alpha: \alpha \in A\}$ be a partition of unity subordinate to $\{\Psi_\alpha(I \times J): \alpha \in A\}$. The \dfn{Ruelle-Sullivan current} $T_\lambda$ acts on $\varphi \in C^0_\cpt(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$ by 
$$\int_M T_\lambda \wedge \varphi := \sum_{\alpha \in A} \int_{K_\alpha} \left[\int_{\{k\} \times J} (\Psi_\alpha^{-1})^* (\chi_\alpha \varphi)\right] \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
\item Suppose that $\lambda$ is measured oriented. The \dfn{mass} $\Mass(\lambda) := \Mass(T_\lambda)$ and the \dfn{homology class} $[\lambda] := [T_\lambda]$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

In recent work, I interpreted functions of least gradient in terms of their level sets, which form a lamination:

\begin{theorem}[{\cite{BackusCML}}]\label{1 harmonic is MOML}
Suppose that $d \leq 7$ and $u$ is a $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant function on $\tilde M$.
The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $u$ has least gradient.
\item There is a measured oriented minimal lamination $\lambda_u$, which minimizes its mass in its homology class, whose leaves are all of the form $\partial \{u > y\}$ or $\partial \{u < y\}$, $y \in \RR$, and whose Ruelle-Sullivan current is $\dif u$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

By Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms}, if $d \leq 7$, then every nonzero class $\rho \in H^{d - 1}$ contains a tight form $F$, which is related to a function $u$ of least gradient by (\ref{max flow min cut}).
We say that the lamination $\lambda_u$ is a \dfn{measured stretch lamination} associated to $\rho$.
In general, there may be many measured stretch laminations, but our next theorem, proven in \S\ref{proof of Theorem B}, characterizes the measured stretch laminations.

\begin{mainthm}\label{lams are calibrated}
Suppose that $d \leq 7$.
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ be nonzero.
Let $\kappa$ be a measured stretch lamination for $\rho$, and let $[F] = \rho$ satisfy $\Comass(F) = \Comass(\rho)$.
Then $\kappa$ is $F/\Comass(\rho)$-calibrated, and for $\lambda$ ranging over measured oriented laminations,
\begin{equation}\label{duality between stable and comass}
\Comass(\rho) = \sup_\lambda \frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle}{\Mass(\lambda)} = \frac{\langle \rho, [\kappa]\rangle}{\Mass(\kappa)}.
\end{equation}
Conversely, if a measured oriented lamination $\lambda$ attains the maximum in (\ref{duality between stable and comass}), then $\lambda$ is a measured stretch lamination.
\end{mainthm}

Given our previous work \cite{BackusCML} and Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms}, the only difficulty in the proof of Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated} is to verify that it is meaningful to ask if a lamination be $F$-calibrated when $F$ is only measurable, but not continuous.
This technicality aside, the proof of Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated} is based on (\ref{max flow min cut}), which says that if $F$ is tight and $\Comass(\rho) = 1$, then $F$ calibrates $\kappa$.
Since calibration is a cohomological invariant, any other calibration representing $\rho$ must also calibrate $\kappa$.
Conversely, if $F$ calibrates $\lambda$, then $\lambda$ must arise from some function of least gradient satisfying (\ref{max flow min cut}).

Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated} immediately implies the Bangert--Cui theorem (Theorem \ref{Bangert MFMC}), and is stronger than the Bangert--Cui theorem because we need not assume that $\rho$ contains a continuous calibration.
In general, it seems unlikely that $\Comass(\rho) = 1$ implies that $\rho$ contains a continuous calibration, though this is known to hold when $d = 2$ \cite{Evans08} or when $M$ is Ricci-flat. 
Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated} also implies the Daskalopolous--Uhlenbeck theorem (Theorem \ref{Daskalopolous MFMC}): if $d = 2$, then a $1$-form $F$ is tight iff a local primitive of $F$ is $\infty$-harmonic.

The duality relation (\ref{duality between stable and comass}) has already been interpreted in the string theory literature as a continuous analogue of the max flow min cut theorem \cite{Freedman_2016}, at least in the case that $\lambda$ has only one leaf.
On the other hand, one can think of $\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle/\Mass(\lambda)$ as the amount that $\lambda$ is ``stretched'' by a representative of $\rho$, or in other words we can think of it as analogous to Thurston's functional $K$ \cite[\S5.3]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
So (\ref{duality between stable and comass}) is an analogue of Thurston's formula (\ref{Thurston MFMC formula}), and Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated} can be viewed as an explanation for why the max flow min cut theorem should appear in Thurston's conjecture.

The analogy with Thurston's theorem, Theorem \ref{Thurston MFMC}, can be made even stronger.
In Thurston's theorem, there are many maximally stretched measured geodesic laminations, but one can embed all of them in a uniquely defined \dfn{canonical maximally stretched lamination} $\lambda(\rho, \sigma)$, which can be used to study the duality of the tangent and cotangent bundles of $\mathscr T_\gamma$.
In our situation, while there may be many measured stretch laminations $\rho$, we will embed them all in a \dfn{canonical calibrated lamination} $\lambda(\rho)$, as I will show in an upcoming companion paper \cite{BackusBest2}.
Moreover, I will show that $\lambda(\rho)$ can be used to prove facts about the duality between the costable and stable norms, some of which were claimed but not proven by Auer and Bangert \cite{Auer01}.

Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated} is based on the fact that the level sets of a function of least gradient are area-minimizing hypersurfaces, but one can seek to formulate such a result for eigenfunctions of the $1$-Laplacian instead.
The superlevel sets of the first eigenfunction are \dfn{Cheeger sets} -- sets $U$ which maximize the isoperimetric ratio $\Mass(\partial U)/\vol(U)$ \cite{Kawohl2003}.
The dual $d - 1$-forms $F$ are not closed, but instead satisfy $\dif F \geq 0$; one can also interpret this fact as a continuous max flow min cut theorem \cite{Grieser05}.
It would be interesting to study the $L^\infty$ one-sided variational problem that $F$ solves in this setting, but we shall not attempt to do so.

\subsection{The \texorpdfstring{$L^\infty$ variational}{L-infinity variational} model system}
In \S\ref{infinityMax} of the paper we scrutinize the $L^\infty$ variational problem defining tight forms.
At present there is not a suitable theory of viscosity solutions of PDEs for vector-valued maps, and in general, one does not expect our tight forms to be much more regular than $L^\infty$.
However, we formally derive what analytic properties tight forms \emph{should} have, in the tradition of various other papers \cite{Barron2001,Aronsson67,Sheffield12} on the $L^\infty$ calculus of variations.

To be more precise, we study $C^1$ solutions of the PDE 
\begin{equation}\label{tight Einstein}
\begin{cases}\dif F = 0, \\
	(\nabla_i F_{j_1 \cdots j_{d - 1}}) F^{j_1 \cdots j_{d - 1}} {F^i}_{k_1 \cdots k_{d - 2}} = 0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
We derive this equation as the formal limit of the PDE solved by the $p$-tight forms.
Therefore tight forms are variational solutions of (\ref{tight Einstein}).
We are particularly interested in this equation not just because it is formally solved by tight forms, but because it seems to be a model problem for $L^\infty$ variational systems, in particular the optimal Lipschitz extension problem \cite{Sheffield12,daskalopoulos2022,daskalopoulos2023}.

When $d = 2$, (\ref{tight Einstein}) asserts that $F = \dif v$, where $v$ is $\infty$-harmonic:
$$(\nabla_i \partial_j v) \partial^i v \partial^j v = 0.$$
In that case it is well known that $\ker(\star F)$ integrates to a geodesic foliation \cite[Proof of Theorem 1.5]{Sheffield12}.
In general, (\ref{tight Einstein}) can be interpreted as asserting that the distribution $\ker(\star F)$ is ``calibrated" by $F$, though $\ker(\star F)$ need not be integrable.
If it is integrable, then we show in \S\ref{EL interpretation} the following variational interpretation which generalizes the interpretation of $\infty$-harmonic functions as absolute minimizing Lipschitz.

\begin{mainthm}\label{tight are absolute minimizers}
Let $F$ be a closed $C^1$ $d - 1$-form on a compact Riemannian manifold (possibly with boundary). Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If, for every sufficiently ball $B$,
\begin{equation}\label{absolute minimizer}
\|F\|_{C^0(B)} = \|F\|_{C^0(\partial B)},
\end{equation}
then $F$ solves (\ref{tight Einstein}).
\item Suppose that $\ker(\star F)$ is a singular integrable distribution. If $F$ solves (\ref{tight Einstein}), then for every sufficiently small ball $B$, (\ref{absolute minimizer}) holds.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mainthm}

In \S\ref{nonintegrability}, we show that the assumption that $B$ is a small ball cannot be removed.
We also show that the rather surprising fact that if the integrability hypothesis is removed, then $F$ is not a minimizer even globally.
These defects appear to be generic features of the theory of $L^\infty$ variational systems, which are altogether unlike the behavior of the scalar $\infty$-Laplacian.

\section{Tight forms and functions of least gradient}\label{tight forms sec}
In this section we shall prove Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms}, by studying properties of $p$-tight forms.
Unless noted otherwise, $M$ shall denote a closed oriented Riemannian manifold, $\tilde M \to M$ will be the universal covering.
Let $M_{\rm fun} \subseteq \tilde M$ be a fundamental domain of $M$, and let $\Gamma := \pi_1(M)$.

\subsection{Homological properties of \texorpdfstring{$q$-harmonic}{q-harmonic} functions}
Let $\alpha \in \Hom(\Gamma, \RR)$ be a representation.
It defines a cohomology class in $H^1(M, \RR)$ by Hurcewiz' theorem, which we also denote by $\alpha$.
We also think of $\alpha$ as a harmonic $1$-form sometimes, using the Hodge theorem.
If $u \in BV_\loc(\tilde M, \RR)$ is $\alpha$-equivariant in the sense that for every $\gamma \in \Gamma$ and $x \in \tilde M$,
$$u(\gamma x) = u(x) + \langle \alpha, \gamma\rangle,$$
then $\dif u$ drops to a $d - 1$-current on $M$, and its homology class is $\PD(\alpha)$.\footnote{If $\dif u$ is actually a $1$-form, then of course its cohomology class is $\alpha$, but it turns out that the homology class will be more useful for our purposes.}

We first estimate the energy of an $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic function $u$ in terms of the stable norm $\Mass(\PD(\alpha))$ and the geometry of $M$.
The argument is essentially due to Massart \cite[\S4.2]{Massart96}, who considered the case that $M$ is a hyperbolic surface.
We introduce the \dfn{maximal intersection number}
$$i_M := \sup_{\substack{\xi \in C^\infty(M, \Omega^1) \\ \eta \in C^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})}} \frac{1}{\|\xi\|_{L^1} \|\eta\|_{L^1}} \int_M \xi \wedge \eta$$
which is a positive, finite constant that only depends on the Riemannian manifold $M$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $1/p + 1/q = 1$, and let $u_q: \tilde M \to \RR$ be an $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic function.
Then
\begin{equation}\label{q Laplacian Sobolev regularity estimate}
\vol(M)^{-1/p} \Mass(\alpha) \leq \|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} \leq \vol(M)^{1/q} i_M \Mass(\alpha)
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $u_\infty$ be an $\alpha$-equivariant function which minimizes its Lipschitz constant $\|\dif u_\infty\|_{L^\infty}$ among all $\alpha$-equivariant functions.\footnote{For example, we can take $u_\infty$ to be the $\infty$-harmonic map constructed by Daskalopolous and Uhlenbeck \cite[\S2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.}
Then, since $\dif u_q$ minimizes its $L^q$ norm, we obtain from H\"older's inequality
$$\|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} \leq \|\dif u_\infty\|_{L^q} \leq \vol(M)^{1/q} \|\dif u_\infty\|_{L^\infty}.$$
By the converse to H\"older's inequality, 
$$\|\dif u_\infty\|_{L^\infty} = \sup_{\eta \in C^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})} \frac{1}{\|\eta\|_{L^1}} \int_M \dif u_\infty \wedge \eta.$$
If we now let $v_\varepsilon$ be $\alpha$-equivariant with $\|\dif v_\varepsilon\|_{L^1} \leq \Mass(\alpha) + \varepsilon$, we have by Stokes' theorem
\begin{align*}
\sup_{\eta \in C^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})} \frac{1}{\|\eta\|_{L^1}} \int_M \dif u_\infty \wedge \eta 
&= \sup_{\eta \in C^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})} \frac{1}{\|\eta\|_{L^1}} \int_M \dif v_\varepsilon \wedge \eta\\
&\leq i_M \|\dif v_\varepsilon\|_{L^1} \\
&\leq i_M(\Mass(\alpha) + \varepsilon).
\end{align*}
Taking $\varepsilon \to 0$, we deduce one direction of (\ref{q Laplacian Sobolev regularity estimate}).
In the other direction, we estimate using H\"older's inequality
\begin{align*}
\Mass(\alpha) &\leq \|\dif u_q\|_{L^1} \leq \|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} \vol(M)^{1/p}. \qedhere 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

Since we are interested in the limit $q \to 1$, we must show that convergence of equivariant functions, even in a very weak function space, implies convergence of the representations.

\begin{lemma}\label{L1 convergence preserves pi1}
For each $1 < q \leq 2$, let $\alpha_q$ be a representation, let $u_q$ be an $\alpha_q$-equivariant function on $\tilde M$, and let $u \in L^1_\loc(M, \RR)$.
Suppose that $u_q \to u$ in $L^1_\loc$.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\alpha_q \to \alpha$ for some representation $\alpha$.
\item $u$ is $\alpha$-equivariant.
\item If $\dif u_q \weakto^* \dif u$ and $\dif u_q \in L^q$, then
\begin{equation}\label{q to 1 Holder}
\Mass(\dif u) \leq \liminf_{q \to 1} \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q.
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For each $\gamma \in \Gamma$, let
$$U_\gamma := M_{\rm fun} \cup \gamma_* (M_{\rm fun}).$$
We claim that $(\alpha_q)$ has a convergent subsequence.
To see this, we first recall that $M$ has finite Betti numbers, so $H^1(M, \RR)$ is locally compact.
Therefore, if no convergent subsequence exists, there exists a $\gamma \in \pi_1(M)$ and a subsequence along which $\langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle \to \infty$.
Moreover, since $u_q \to u$ in $L^1_\loc$, $\|u_q\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})} \leq 2\|u\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})}$ if $q - 1$ is small enough.
But then 
$$\|u_q\|_{L^1(\gamma_* M_{\rm fun})} = \|\gamma^* u_q\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})} \geq \langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle - \|u_q\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})} \geq \langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle - 2\|u\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})}$$
and taking $q \to 1$ we conclude that $(u_q)$ is not compact in $L^1(\gamma_* M_{\rm fun})$, contradicting the convergence in $L^1_\loc(\tilde M)$.
So $\alpha_q \to \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in H^1(M, \RR)$ along a subsequence.

For any $q > 1$,
\begin{align*}
\dashint_{M_{\rm fun}} \star |\gamma^* u - u - \langle \alpha, \gamma\rangle| 
&\leq \dashint_{M_{\rm fun}} \star (|\gamma^* u_q - u_q - \langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle| + |\gamma^* u_q - u_q| + |\gamma^* u - u|) \\
&\qquad + |\langle \alpha_q - \alpha, \gamma\rangle|.
\end{align*}
Taking $q \to 1$, we conclude that $\|\gamma^* u - u - \langle \alpha, \gamma\rangle\|_{L^1} = 0$, hence $u$ is $\alpha$-equivariant.
Thus $\alpha$ is uniquely defined and $\alpha_q \to \alpha$ along the entire subsequence.

Finally we prove (\ref{q to 1 Holder}).
Suppose that $\dif u_q \to \dif u$ in the weak topology of measures and $\dif u_q$ in $L^q$.
Then
$$\|\dif u_q\|_{L^1} = \Mass(\dif u_q).$$
So we may use Proposition \ref{portmanteau} and H\"older's inequality to estimate (where $1/p + 1/q = 1$)
\begin{align*}
\Mass(\dif u) &= \lim_{q \to 1} \Mass(\dif u_q) \leq \lim_{q \to 1} \vol(M)^{\frac{1}{p}} \|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} = \lim_{q \to 1} \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q. \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Duality and \texorpdfstring{$p$-tight forms}{p-tight forms}}
Let $1 < p < \infty$ and $1/p + 1/q = 1$.
We now study the $p$-tight forms -- namely, solutions of the PDE (\ref{p tight}).
We restate this PDE for convenience:
$$\begin{cases}\dif F = 0 \\
	\dif^* (|F|^{p - 2} F) = 0.
\end{cases}$$
In Appendix \ref{duality derivation}, we derive (\ref{p tight}) from the duality theorem for convex optimization.

\begin{proposition}
There is a unique $p$-tight form in each cohomology class in $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
Moreover, $p$-tight forms are minimizers of the strictly convex functional
$$J_p(F) := \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p$$
among all forms cohomologous to them.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Strict convexity of $J_p$ on closed $L^p$ $d - 1$-forms is straightforward; since each cohomology class is an affine subspace of $L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$, and hence is convex, the strict convexity on each class follows.
Since $J_p(F) \to \infty$ as $\|F\|_{L^p} \to \infty$, $J_p$ is coercive on $L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$.
Therefore we have existence and uniqueness \cite[Chapter II]{Ekeland99}.
To compute the Euler-Lagrange equations for $J_p$, let $B$ be a $d-2$-form (so $F + t \dif B$ is cohomologous to $F$), so that for a minimizer $F$ of $J_p$,
$$\frac{\dif}{\dif t} J_p(F + t \dif B) = \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |F + t \dif B|^p = \int_M \star |F + t \dif B|^{p - 2} \langle F + t \dif B, \dif B\rangle.$$
Setting $t = 0$, we obtain 
$$0 = \int_M \star |F|^{p - 2} \langle F, \dif B\rangle = \int_M \star \langle \dif^*(|F|^{p - 2} F), B\rangle.$$
Thus the Euler-Lagrange equations for $J_p$ are (\ref{p tight}).
\end{proof}

In Appendix \ref{duality derivation}, we show that every $q$-harmonic function defines a $p$-tight form by the mapping (\ref{dual solution}).
The mapping in the below definition, which sends a $p$-tight form to a $q$-harmonic function, is the inverse of (\ref{dual solution}).

\begin{definition}
Let $F$ be a $p$-tight form on $M$, let
\begin{equation}
\dif u := (-1)^d |F|^{p - 2} \star F, \label{inverse extremality}
\end{equation}
and let $u$ be the primitive of $\dif u$ on the universal cover $\tilde M$, which is normalized to have zero mean on a fundamental domain $M_{\rm fun}$.
Then $u$ is called the \dfn{$q$-harmonic conjugate} of the $p$-tight form $F$.
\end{definition}

Let $u$ be the $q$-harmonic conjugate of a $p$-tight form $F$.
We record that 
\begin{equation}\label{q energy is p energy}
\int_M \star |\dif u|^q = \int_M \star |F|^p.
\end{equation}
By Poincar\'e's inequality,
$$\|u\|_{W^{1, q}(M_{\rm fun})}^q \lesssim \int_M \star |\dif u|^q = \int_M \star |F|^p < \infty$$
since $F$ is $p$-tight; that is, we have $F \in L^p(M)$ and $u \in W^{1, q}_\loc(\tilde M, \RR)$, justifying any manipulations we shall make with these forms.

Our next lemma actually follows from the derivation of (\ref{p tight}) in Appendix \ref{duality derivation}.
However, it is instructive to give a proof which does not use the duality theorem as a black box.

\begin{lemma}
Let $F$ be a $p$-tight form, and let $u$ be its $q$-harmonic conjugate.
Then $u$ is $q$-harmonic, $F$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{dual solution}
F := -|\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u.
\end{equation}
 and we have
\begin{equation}\label{strong duality}
\frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p + \int_M \dif u \wedge F = 0.
\end{equation}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We first use
$$(p - 2)(q - 1) + (q - 2) = 0$$
to prove that
$$|\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u = (-1)^d |F|^{(q - 2)(p - 1)} \star \star |F|^{p - 2} F = - |F|^{(q - 2)(p - 1) - (p - 2)} F = - F.$$
Thus we have (\ref{dual solution}), and moreover
$$\dif \star (|\dif u|^{q - 2} \dif u) = - \dif F = 0$$
so that $u$ is $q$-harmonic.
By (\ref{q energy is p energy}),
$$\frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p = \left[\frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{p}\right] \int_M \star |F|^p = \int_M \star |F|^p.$$
But
$$\int_M \dif u \wedge F = (-1)^d \int_M |F|^{p - 2} \star F \wedge F = \int_M \star |F|^p,$$
so both sides of (\ref{strong duality}) are equal to $\int_M \star |F|^p$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Existence of tight forms}{Existence of tight forms}}
We now show that the $p$-tight forms in a class $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ converge to a form $F$ which minimizes its comass in $\rho$.
In other words, $\Comass(F)$ equals the costable norm $\Comass(\rho)$.

\begin{definition}
A closed $d - 1$-form $F$ has \dfn{best comass} if $\Comass(F) = \Comass([F])$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Let $1 < p < \infty$, let $F_p$ be a $p$-tight form, and let $B$ range over Lipschitz $d - 2$-forms. Then
\begin{equation}\label{infinity magnetic rules p magnetic}
	\|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \vol(M)^{1/p} \inf_B \Comass(F + \dif B)
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By H\"older's inequality and the fact that $F_p$ is $p$-tight,
$$\|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \|F + \dif B\|_{L^p} \leq \vol(M)^{1/p} \|F + \dif B\|_{L^\infty} = \vol(M)^{1/p} \Comass(F + \dif B),$$
hence the same holds for the infimum.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{existence infinity}
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
For each $1 < p < \infty$, let $F_p$ be the $p$-tight form representing $\rho$.
Then there exists a closed $d - 1$-form $F$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F_p \to F$ weakly in $L^r$ along a subsequence, for any $1 < r < \infty$.
\item $F$ is a best comass representative of $\rho$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be an $L^\infty$ representative of $\rho$.
By H\"older's inequality and (\ref{infinity magnetic rules p magnetic}), for every $r$,
\begin{equation}\label{uniform bounds in p by best curl}
	\|F_p\|_{L^r} \leq \vol(M)^{\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{p}} \|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \vol(M)^{\frac{1}{r}} \|G\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}
Thus a compactness argument gives $F_p \to F$ for some $d - 1$-form $F$, weakly in $L^r$, and 
$$\|F\|_{L^r} \leq \liminf_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^r} \leq \vol(M)^{\frac{1}{r}} \|G\|_{L^\infty}.$$
Diagonalizing, we may assume that $F_p \to F$ weakly in $L^r$ for every such $r$, and taking $r \to \infty$, we conclude 
\begin{equation}\label{infinity magnetics have best curl}
	\|F\|_{L^\infty} \leq \|G\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}
Moreover, $[F] = \lim_{p \to \infty} [F_p] = \rho$.
Since $G$ was arbitrary in (\ref{infinity magnetics have best curl}), $F$ has best comass.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
The $d - 1$-form $F$ of best comass in Proposition \ref{existence infinity} is called a \dfn{tight form}.
\end{definition}

It is a corollary of Proposition \ref{existence infinity} that every cohomology class is represented by a form of best comass.
This could be shown more directly using Alaoglu's theorem on the weakstar topology of $L^\infty$.
However, since $p$-tight forms are intimately related to $q$-harmonic functions, it is more convenient to work with tight forms than general forms of best comass.

\begin{lemma}\label{p tights approximate L}
Let $F_p$ be the $p$-tight representative of $\rho$. Then 
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^p} = \Comass(\rho).$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We follow \cite[Lemma 2.7]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Let $F$ be a best comass representative of $\rho$, so
$$\|F\|_{L^\infty} = \Comass(F) = \Comass(\rho).$$
Since $F_p$ is $p$-tight, H\"older's inequality implies 
$$\|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \|F\|_{L^p} \leq \vol(M)^{\frac{1}{p}} \Comass(\rho).$$
Therefore 
$$\limsup_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \Comass(\rho).$$
To prove the converse, suppose that for some $\varepsilon > 0$,
$$\liminf_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \Comass(\rho) - \varepsilon < \Comass(\rho).$$
Along a subsequence which attains the limit inferior, $F_p$ converges weakly in every $L^r$ to a tight form $\tilde F$ such that (by H\"older's inequality)
$$\|\tilde F\|_{L^r} \leq \liminf_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^r} \leq \liminf_{p \to \infty} \vol(M)^{\frac{1}{r}} \|\tilde F\|_{L^\infty} \leq \vol(M)^{\frac{1}{r}} (\Comass(\rho) - \varepsilon).$$
Taking $r \to \infty$, we obtain $\Comass(\tilde F) < \Comass(\rho)$, which contradicts the definition of the costable norm $\Comass(\rho)$.
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$1$-harmonic conjugates of tight forms}{One-harmonic conjugates of tight forms}}
We now construct the $1$-harmonic conjugates of a tight form.
In the special case that the tight form $F$ is a calibration, that is $\Comass(F) = 1$, a $1$-harmonic conjugate will be a $1$-harmonic function on the universal cover whose level sets are calibrated by $F$.

\begin{definition}
Let $F$ be a tight form of cohomology class $\rho$.
A nonconstant $\Gamma$-equivariant function of least gradient $u \in BV_\loc(\tilde M)$ is called a \dfn{$1$-harmonic conjugate} of $F$ if
\begin{equation}\label{1 extremality}
\dif u \wedge F = \Comass(\rho) \star |\dif u|.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

By Proposition \ref{Anzellotti wedge product exists}, the wedge product $\dif u \wedge F$ exists as an Anzellotti wedge product, in particular as a Radon measure, and
$$\Mass(\dif u \wedge F) \leq \Comass(F) \Mass(\dif u) = \Comass(\rho) \Mass(\dif u).$$

We are going to derive (\ref{1 extremality}) as a limit of the duality relation (\ref{strong duality}), which itself was a consequence of the convex duality theorem.
But (\ref{inverse extremality}) blows up as $p \to \infty$, so we must ``renormalize'' it before taking the limit $q \to 1$, as in \cite[\S3.2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
This goal is accomplished by the next lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{normalizations converge}
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}$, and let $k_p$ satisfy 
$$k_p^{1 - p} = \int_M \star |F_p|^p$$
where $F_p$ is the $p$-tight representative of $\rho$.
Then, as $p \to \infty$, $k_p \to \Comass(\rho)^{-1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We follow \cite[Lemma 3.4]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
By Lemma \ref{p tights approximate L},
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} k_p^{-\frac{1}{q}} = \lim_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^p} = \Comass(\rho).$$
Taking logarithms we see that $q^{-1} \log k_p \to -\log \Comass(\rho)$, and since $q \to 1$ the claim follows.
\end{proof}

Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms} follows from the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}\label{existence 1}
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ be nonzero, let $F_p$ be its $p$-tight representative, and let 
$$F := \lim_{p \to \infty} F_p$$
be the tight representative of $F$.
Let $1/p + 1/q = 1$, and let $u_q$ be the function on $\tilde M$ with mean zero on $M_{\rm fun}$ and
$$\dif u_q = (-1)^{d - 1} k_p^{p - 1} |F_p|^{p - 2} \star F_p.$$
Then there exists $u \in BV_\loc(\tilde M)$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Along a subsequence as $q \to 1$, $u_q \weakto^* u$ in $BV_\loc(\tilde M)$, and for every $1 \leq r < \frac{d}{d - 1}$, $u_q \to u$ in $L^r(\tilde M)$.
\item $u$ is a $1$-harmonic conjugate of $F$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $L := \Comass(\rho)$.
We first compute using H\"older's inequality and Lemma \ref{normalizations converge}
\begin{align}
\lim_{q \to 1} \|\dif u_q\|_{L^1}
&\leq \lim_{q \to 1} \vol(M)^{\frac{1}{p}} \left[\int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q\right]^{\frac{1}{q}} = \lim_{p \to \infty} \left[k_p^p \int_M \star |F_p|^p\right]^{\frac{1}{q}} \label{Rellich 1}\\
&= \lim_{p \to \infty} k_p^{\frac{1}{q}} = \lim_{p \to \infty} k_p = \frac{1}{L} \label{Rellich 2}.
\end{align}
So by Rellich's theorem, $(u_q)$ is weakly compact in $BV$ and strongly compact in $L^r$ for $1 \leq r < \frac{d}{d - 1}$.
In particular, $\dif u_q \to \dif u$ in the weak topology of measures and $u_q \to u$ weakly in $BV$ and strongly in $L^r$.
As the limit of $\Gamma$-equivariant functions, $u$ is also $\Gamma$-equivariant by Lemma \ref{L1 convergence preserves pi1}.
In particular, $\dif u$ drops to a current on $M$.
Moreover, $[\dif u_q] \to [\dif u]$, and we have the bound (\ref{q to 1 Holder}) on $\Mass(\dif u)$.

We next must check that $u$ is nonconstant.
If $u$ is constant, then it is $\Gamma$-invariant, so $[\dif u_q] \to 0$.
By (\ref{q Laplacian Sobolev regularity estimate}), $\|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} \to 0$, so by (\ref{Rellich 1}, \ref{Rellich 2}), $L = \infty$, which is absurd.
Therefore $u$ is nonconstant.

Renormalizing (\ref{strong duality}), we obtain 
$$\frac{k_p^{-p}}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F_p|^p = k_p^{1 - p} \int_M \dif u_q \wedge F_p.$$
Multiplying by $k_p^p$, we have 
\begin{equation}\label{1 strong duality before limits}
	\frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q + \frac{k_p^p}{p} \int_M \star |F_p|^p = k_p \int_M \dif u_q \wedge F_p.
\end{equation}

Let $\mu(U) := \Mass_U(\dif u)$ be the total variation measure of $\dif u$.
We claim that
\begin{equation}\label{1 strong duality}
	L\mu(M) \leq \int_M \dif u \wedge F.
\end{equation}
First, we have from (\ref{q to 1 Holder}) and (\ref{1 strong duality before limits}) that
$$\mu(M) \leq \lim_{q \to 1} \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q = \lim_{p \to \infty} k_p \int_M \dif u_q \wedge F_p - \lim_{p \to \infty} \frac{k_p^p}{p} \int_M \star |F_p|^p.$$
By Lemma \ref{normalizations converge},
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \frac{k_p^p}{p} \int_M \star |F_p|^p = \lim_{p \to \infty} \frac{k_p}{p} = \frac{0}{L} = 0,$$
and
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} k_p \int_M \dif u_q \wedge F_p = \frac{1}{L} \lim_{p \to \infty} \int_M [\dif u_q] \wedge \rho.$$
Since $[\dif u_q] \to [\dif u]$, we obtain
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \int_M [\dif u_q] \wedge \rho = \int_M \alpha \wedge \rho = \int_M \dif u \wedge F,$$
completing the proof of (\ref{1 strong duality}).

By the coarea formula (\ref{coarea formula}), we have for any open set $U$,
$$\int_U \dif u \wedge F = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{U \cap \partial \{u > y\}} F \dif y \leq L \int_{-\infty}^\infty |U \cap \partial \{u > y\}| \dif y = L \mu(U).$$
Since $\mu$ is a Radon measure and $M$ is compact, every Borel set $E$ can be $\mu$-approximated from without by open sets, hence
\begin{equation}\label{one sided extremality}
\int_E \dif u \wedge F \leq L \mu(E).
\end{equation}
In particular, $\mu(M) = \int_M \dif u \wedge F$ by (\ref{1 strong duality}).
From this, we deduce (\ref{1 extremality}): if it is false, then by (\ref{one sided extremality}), there is a Borel set $E$ such that 
$$\int_E \dif u \wedge F < L \mu(E),$$
so by (\ref{one sided extremality}),
\begin{align*}
L\mu(M) &= L\mu(E) + L\mu(M \setminus E) < \int_E \dif u \wedge F + \int_{M \setminus E} \dif u \wedge F \\
&= \int_M \dif u \wedge F 
= L\mu(M),
\end{align*}
which is absurd.

Finally, we show that $u$ is a function of least gradient.
We follow the proof of the fundamental theorem of calibrated geometry.
Let $v$ be $\Gamma$-invariant.
Then, by (\ref{1 extremality}), Stokes' theorem, and the fact that $F$ has best comass,
$$\Mass(\dif u) \Comass(\rho) = \int_M \dif u \wedge F = \int_M (\dif u + \dif v) \wedge F \leq \Mass(\dif u + \dif v) \Comass(F) = \Mass(\dif u + \dif v) \Comass(\rho).$$
We conclude that $\Mass(\dif u) \leq \Mass(\dif v)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Counterexamples for manifolds with boundary}\label{boundaries bad}
We now observe that Proposition \ref{existence 1} fails on manifolds with boundary, in spite of the fact that the complementary Maz\'on Theorem \todo{merge me} holds even on domains with boundary.
The proof fails exactly due to the fact that the $q$-Dirichlet energy can ``leak out of the boundary'' as $q \to 1$.

To be more precise, the estimate on $q$-harmonic functions (\ref{q Laplacian Sobolev regularity estimate}) fails on compact domains with boundary.
Since $\Mass(\alpha)$ is the $1$-Dirichlet energy of an $\alpha$-equivariant function of least gradient, the natural analogue of this estimate on a contractible domain $M$ is
\begin{equation}\label{least gradient can be zero}
\|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} \sim \inf_{f|_{\partial M} = h} \Mass(\dif f)
\end{equation}
whenever $h \in L^2(\partial M)$ and $u_q$ are $q$-harmonic functions such that $u_q|_{\partial M} = u|_{\partial M} = h$.
Taking $M$ to be a square and $h$ to be the indicator function of one of the edges $\Sigma$ of $\partial M$ provides an example where the right-hand side of (\ref{least gradient can be zero}) is zero but there are (necessarily nonzero) $q$-harmonic functions $u_q$ of $h$.

The above phenomenon occurred because $\Sigma$ is a geodesic.
However, more sophisticated constructions based on fat Cantor sets shows that (\ref{least gradient can be zero}) fails even when $M$ is a disk \cite{Spradlin14}.
A similar argument shows that the analogue of Lemma \ref{L1 convergence preserves pi1}, which would assert that a sequence of $q$-harmonic functions $u_q$ converging weakly in $BV$ to some function $u$ would have $u_q|_{\partial M} \to u|_{\partial M}$, cannot hold.

Thus we do not expect a tight form to have a $1$-harmonic conjugate on a manifold with boundary.
Here is an explicit example when $M$ is a square.
This example uses the fact that the square is not strictly mean-convex, so it would be interesting to modify the fat Cantor set example to show that Proposition \ref{existence 1} fails even when $M$ is a disk; we shall not attempt to do so here.

\begin{example}
Let $M = (0, 1)^2$ and $F := (1 - x) \dif y$.
Then
$$\dif(|F|^{p - 2} \star F) = \dif((1 - x)^{p - 1} \star \dif y) = -\dif((1 - x)^{p - 1} \dif x) = 0$$
so $F$ is $p$-tight for every $1 < p < \infty$, hence is tight.
If $u$ satisfies (\ref{1 extremality}), then
$$\supp \dif u \subseteq \{|F| = \|F\|_{C^0}\} = \emptyset,$$
so $u$ is constant.
\end{example}

\section{Calibrations of laminations}\label{comass sec}
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$L^\infty$}{L-infinity} calibrations of laminations}\label{L infinity calibrations}
The goal of the present series of papers is to study calibrations of laminations.
If the calibration $F$ is continuous, then the theory of \cite{bangert_cui_2017} of calibrated laminations applies; however, we are not aware of general existence results on continuous calibrations, only $L^\infty$ calibrations, such as \cite[\S4.12]{Federer1974}.
Thus, we now introduce $L^\infty$ calibrations of laminations.

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{calibration} of degree $d - 1$ is a closed $d - 1$-form $F$ such that $\Comass(F) = 1$.
A $d - 1$-current $T$ is $F$-\dfn{calibrated} if 
\begin{equation}\label{calibration of current}
\Mass(T) = \int_M T \wedge F.
\end{equation}
A lamination $\lambda$ is \dfn{$F$-calibrated} if every leaf of $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated.
\end{definition}

By the coarea formula (\ref{coarea formula}), the integrand $T \wedge F$ in the equation (\ref{calibration of current}) makes sense whenever $T$ is a current\footnote{Recall our convention from Appendix \ref{GMT appendix} that every current has locally finite mass unless explicitly stated otherwise.} such that $\dif T$ is sufficiently smooth, $F \in L^\infty_\loc$, and $\dif F \in L^d_\loc$.

We recall the fundamental theorem of calibrated geometry \cite{Harvey82}: if $T$ is an $F$-calibrated current, then $T$ is homologically minimizing relative to $\dif T$.
Indeed, if $T - S = \dif R$, then 
$$\Mass(T) = \int_M T \wedge F = \int_M S \wedge F \leq \Mass(S)$$
where the integral of $\dif R \wedge F$ vanished by integration by parts and the last integral was estimated using the triangle inequality.
A dual result to this theorem is that if $T$ is an $F$-calibrated current and $\dif T = 0$, then $F$ has best comass: if $F - G = \dif B$, then 
$$\|F\|_{L^\infty} = \frac{1}{\Mass(T)} \int_M T \wedge F = \frac{1}{\Mass(T)} \int_M T \wedge G \leq \|G\|_{L^\infty}$$
where we again used integration by parts and the triangle inequality.

A smooth hypersurface $N$ is $F$-calibrated iff the pullback $\iota_N^* F$ is the area form on $N$.
The pullback map $\iota_N^*$ is well-defined by Proposition \ref{integration is welldefined}.
In particular, $\iota_N^* F$ is smooth and $N$ is oriented.
If $\lambda$ is an $F$-calibrated lamination, then the trace $\iota_\lambda^* F$ is defined to be $\iota_N^* F$ along any leaf $N$.
A priori, $\lambda$ could fail to be orientable, and then $\iota_\lambda^* F$ would be necessarily discontinuous.
However, we assert that a calibrated lamination is orientable:

\begin{proposition}\label{calibrated implies oriented}
Let $F$ be a calibration and $\lambda$ an $F$-calibrated lamination.
Then $\iota_\lambda^* F$ is continuous, and $F$ induces an orientation on $\lambda$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $N$ be a leaf of $\lambda$ and $x \in N$.
Let $\mathscr O$ be the local orientation of $\lambda$ near $x$ which is compatible with $F(x)$. 

There exists a continuous $d - 1$-form $G$ such that $y \in K$ close enough to $x$, $K$ a leaf of $\lambda$, $G(y) = \dif S_K(y)$ is the area form of $K$ with respect to $\mathscr O$.
In fact, we can fill in the spaces between the leaves by linear interpolation.
Then for any $y \in \supp \lambda$ close to $x$, either $F(y) = G(y)$ or $F(y) = -G(y)$; we claim that $F(y) = G(y)$ if $\dist(x, y)$ is small enough.
If this claim is true, then the proposition follows, since $G$ is continuous at $x$.

To prove the claim, we suppose towards contradiction that there is a sequence $(x_n) \subset \supp \lambda$ with $x_n \to x$ and $F(x_n) = -G(x_n)$.
We may write $F = \dif A$ where $A$ is continuous near $x$ by Proposition \ref{Hodge theorem}.
Let $N_n$ be the leaf of $\lambda$ containing $x_n$; then $N_n$ is minimal, hence smooth, so $F_n|_{N_n}$ is smooth.
Therefore by Stokes' theorem, if $(D_{n, m})$ is a sequence of disks in $N_n$ which shrink down to $x_n$ as $m \to \infty$ and are equipped with the orientation $\mathscr O$,
$$-1 = \lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{1}{\Mass(D_{n, m})} \int_{D_{n, m}} F = \lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{1}{\Mass(D_{n, m})} \int_{\partial D_{n, m}} A.$$
In particular, we can choose $m_n \to \infty$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{orientation contradiction}
\int_{\partial D_{n, m_n}} A \leq 0.
\end{equation}
We set $D_n := D_{n, m_n}$.

Let $(k, z) \in \RR \times \RR^{d - 1}$ be coordinates near $x$ with respect to a flow box, where $k$ indexes the leaves and $z$ is a parameter on each leaf.
Then $D_n = \{k_n\} \times \Omega_n$ for some $\Omega_n \subset \RR^{d - 1}$.
Let $k$ be the index of $N$ and $D_n' := \{k\} \times \Omega_n$.
Since $A$ is continuous, $A(k, z) = A(k_n, z) + o(1)$ as $n \to \infty$, hence
\begin{equation}\label{orientation contradiction 2}
\frac{1}{\Mass(D_n')} \int_{\partial D_n'} A = \frac{1}{\Mass(D_n)} \int_{\partial D_n} A + o(1).
\end{equation}
However, $D_n'$ shrinks down to $x$, and $F(x) = G(x)$, so by Stokes' theorem, for $n$ large,
$$\int_{\partial D_n'} A \gtrsim \Mass(D_n'),$$
hence by (\ref{orientation contradiction}) and (\ref{orientation contradiction 2}),
$$0 < \Mass(D_n) \lesssim \int_{\partial D_n} A \leq 0,$$
a contradiction.
\end{proof}

We next give a natural condition for a lamination to be calibrated.
To state it, we record the following immediate consequence of the coarea formula (\ref{coarea formula}).

\begin{lemma}
Let $(\lambda, \mu)$ be a measured oriented lamination on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$.
Suppose that $F \in L^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$ has $\dif F \in L^p(M, \Omega^d)$.
Let $(\chi_\alpha)$ be a locally finite partition of unity subordinate to an open cover $(U_\alpha)$ of flow boxes for $\lambda$.
Let $\sigma_{\alpha, k}$ be the leaf of $\lambda \cap U_\alpha$ with parameter $k \in I$.
Then
\begin{equation}\label{coarea formula on laminations}
\int_M T_\lambda \wedge F = \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k).
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

On the other hand, if $F$ is a closed $d - 1$-form and $M$ is closed, then $\int_M T_\lambda \wedge F = \langle [\lambda], [F]\rangle$ is simply the pairing of homology and cohomology.

\begin{proposition}\label{calibration condition}
Let $F$ be a calibration on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$.
Let $T_\lambda$ be the Ruelle-Sullivan current of a measured oriented lamination $\lambda$.
Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item One has \begin{equation}\label{calibration by Ruelle Sullivan}
\int_M T_\lambda \wedge F = \Mass(\lambda).
\end{equation}
\item $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First suppose that (\ref{calibration by Ruelle Sullivan}) holds.
Let $(\chi_\alpha)$ be a locally finite partition of unity subordinate to an open cover $(U_\alpha)$ of flow boxes for $\lambda$, and let $(\mu_\alpha)$ be the transverse measure.
After refining $(U_\alpha)$ we may assume that $U_\alpha$ is contained in a deformed euclidean ball as in Appendix \ref{GMT appendix}. After shrinking $U_\alpha$ we may assume that $\chi_\alpha > 0$ on $U_\alpha$.
Then for some hypersurfaces $\sigma_{\alpha,k}$,
$$\Mass(\lambda) = \int_M T_\lambda \wedge F = \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha,k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
Let $\dif S_{\alpha,k}$ be the surface measure on $\sigma_{\alpha,k}$.
Then
$$\int_M \chi_\alpha \star |T_\lambda| = \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha,k}} \chi_\alpha \dif S_{\alpha,k} \dif \mu_\alpha(k),$$
so summing in $\alpha$, we obtain 
\begin{equation}\label{calibration condition contr}
\sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha,k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k) = \Mass(\lambda) = \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha,k}} \chi_\alpha \dif S_{\alpha,k} \dif \mu_\alpha(k).
\end{equation}

We claim that $\lambda$ is \dfn{almost calibrated} in the sense that for every $\alpha$ and $\mu_\alpha$-almost every $k$, $\sigma_{\alpha, k}$ is calibrated.
If this is not true, then we may select $\beta$ and $K \subseteq I$ with $\mu_\beta(K) > 0$, such that for every $k \in K$, $\int_{\sigma_{\beta, k}} F < \Mass(\sigma_{\beta, k})$.
Since $0 < \chi_\beta \leq 1$ and $F/\dif S_{\beta, k} \leq 1$ on $\sigma_{\beta, k}$, this is only possible if 
$$\int_{\sigma_{\beta, k}} \chi_\beta F < \int_{\sigma_{\beta, k}} \chi_\beta \dif S_{\beta, k}.$$
Integrating over $K$, and using the fact that in general we have $\int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha F \leq \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha \dif S_{\alpha, k}$, we conclude that 
$$\sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k) < \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha \dif S_{\alpha, k} \dif \mu_\alpha(k)$$
which contradicts (\ref{calibration condition contr}).

To upgrade $\lambda$ from an almost calibrated lamination to a calibrated lamination, we first, given $\sigma_{\alpha, k}$, choose $k_j$ such that $\sigma_{\alpha, k_j}$ is calibrated and $k_j \to k$.
By Proposition \ref{Hodge theorem}, we can find a continuous $d - 2$-form $A$ defined near $\sigma_{\alpha, k}$ with $F = \dif A$.
This justifies the following application of Stokes' theorem: 
$$\int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} F = \int_{\partial \sigma_{\alpha, k}} A.$$
Since $k_j \to k$, and $A$ is continuous,
\begin{align*}
\Mass(\sigma_{\alpha, k}) &= \lim_{j \to \infty} \Mass(\sigma_{\alpha, k_j}) = \lim_{j \to \infty} \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k_j}} F = \lim_{j \to \infty} \int_{\partial \sigma_{\alpha, k_j}} A = \int_{\partial \sigma_{\alpha, k}} A = \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} F.
\end{align*}

To establish the converse, suppose that $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated, and let notation be as above.
Since $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated, for every $\alpha$ and every $k$, the area form on $\sigma_{\alpha, k}$ is $F$. Therefore
\begin{align*}
\int_M T_\lambda \wedge F &= \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k) = \Mass(T_\lambda). \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{properties of calibrated laminations}
Suppose that $M$ is a closed Riemannian manifold, $F$ is a calibration, and $\lambda$ is a measured $F$-calibrated lamination.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\lambda$ is minimal and homologically minimizing.
\item If $G$ is a calibration and cohomologous to $F$, then $\lambda$ is $G$-calibrated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Every leaf of $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated, hence minimal, so $\lambda$ is also minimal.
Since $\lambda$ is oriented by Proposition \ref{calibrated implies oriented}, it has a Ruelle-Sullivan current.
Then, since (\ref{calibration by Ruelle Sullivan}) only depends on the cohomology class of $F$, not $F$ itself, $\lambda$ is $G$-calibrated.
From (\ref{calibration by Ruelle Sullivan}) and the fundamental theorem of calibrated geometry, $\lambda$ is homologically minimizing.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Existence of measured stretch laminations}\label{proof of Theorem B}
Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian of dimension $d \leq 7$ equipped with a cohomology class $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
To ease notation, we normalize the costable norm:
$$\Comass(\rho) = 1.$$
By Theorem \ref{1 harmonic is MOML}, every function $u$ of least gradient gives rise to a homologically minimizing lamination $\kappa_u$.
Thus the following definition makes sense:

\begin{definition}
Let $F$ be a tight representative of $\rho$, and let $u$ be a $1$-harmonic conjugate of $F$.
Then we call $\kappa_u$ a \dfn{measured stretch lamination} associated to $\rho$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{MCL contains Thurston}
Let $F$ be a best comass representative of $\rho$, and let $\lambda$ be a measured stretch lamination associated to $\rho$.
Then $F$ calibrates $\lambda$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be the tight form which is cohomologous to $F$ whose dual $1$-harmonic function $u$ defines the measured stretch lamination $\lambda$.
Then by (\ref{1 extremality}), 
$$\Mass(\lambda) = \Mass(\dif u) = \int_M \dif u \wedge G$$
so $G$ calibrates $\lambda$ by Proposition \ref{calibration condition}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{L equals K}
	Let $\kappa$ be a measured stretch lamination for $\rho$, and let $\lambda$ range over measured oriented laminations. Then 
	\begin{equation}\label{L equals K formula}
	\sup_\lambda \frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle}{\Mass(\lambda)} = \frac{\langle \rho, [\kappa]\rangle}{\Mass(\kappa)} = 1.
	\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Fix a tight form $F$ representing $\rho$, and let $u$ be its $1$-harmonic conjugate.
Let
$$K :=  \sup_\lambda \frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle}{|\lambda|}.$$

We first prove $K \leq 1$.
Let $\lambda$ be a measured oriented lamination; then, since $F$ represents $\rho$ and the Ruelle-Sullivan current $T_\lambda$ represents $[\lambda]$,
$$\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle = \int_M F \wedge T_\lambda.$$
Let $(\chi_\alpha)$ be a partition of unity subordinate to a laminar atlas for $\lambda$, and let $(\mu_\alpha)$ be the associated transverse measure. Then 
$$\int_M F \wedge T_\lambda = \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\{k\} \times J} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
Since $F$ has best comass,
$$\frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda] \rangle}{\Mass(\lambda)}
\leq \frac{\|F\|_{L^\infty}}{\Mass(\lambda)} \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\{k\} \times J} \chi_\alpha \dif S_k \dif \mu_\alpha(k) = 1.$$
Since $\lambda$ was arbitrary, it holds that $K \leq 1$.

By (\ref{1 extremality}),
$$\langle \rho, [\kappa]\rangle = \int_M F \wedge \dif u = \Mass(\dif u) = \Mass(\kappa).$$
Dividing both sides by $\Mass(\kappa)$ and applying the direction we already proved,
$$K \leq 1 \leq \frac{\langle \rho, [\kappa]\rangle}{\Mass(\kappa)} \leq K$$
which is only possible if $K = 1$ and $\kappa$ is a maximizer.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{calibrated means measured stretch}
Let $F$ be a best comass representative of $\rho$, and suppose that $F$ calibrates a measured oriented lamination $\lambda$.
Then $\lambda$ is a measured stretch lamination associated to $\rho$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\dif u$ be the Ruelle-Sullivan current for $\lambda$, and suppose that $f \in C^0(M)$ is supported in a flow box for $\lambda$, with local leaf space $K$ and transverse measure $\mu$.
By Proposition \ref{properties of calibrated laminations}, we may assume wihout loss of generality that $F$ is tight.
Since $F$ calibrates every leaf of $\lambda$,
$$\int_M f \star |\dif u| = \int_K \int_{\{k\} \times J} f \dif S_{\{k\} \times J} \dif \mu(k) = \int_K \int_{\{k\} \times J} fF \dif \mu(k) = \int_M f\dif u \wedge F$$
Thus $\dif u \wedge F = \star |\dif u|$, or in other words $u$ is a $1$-harmonic conjugate of the tight form $F$.
Therefore $\lambda$ is a measured stretch lamination.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Let $F$ be a best comass representative of $\rho$, and suppose that $F$ calibrates a measured oriented lamination $\lambda$.
Then $\lambda$ is Lipschitz.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem \ref{1 harmonic is MOML}, every measured stretch lamination is Lipschitz.
\end{proof}

\todo{Mention that this is a softer proof of DU '20's proof that the least gradient function is contained in every best Lipschitz map's stretch set.}

\section{The Euler-Lagrange equation for tight forms}\label{infinityMax}
\subsection{Formal derivation of Euler-Lagrange equation}
To state our Euler-Lagrange equation we introduce some notation for derivatives of tensor fields along differential forms.
If $\alpha$ is a $k$-form, $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection, and $T$ is a section of a tensor bundle $E$, we introduce the tensor $\nabla^\alpha T$, a section of $E \otimes \Omega^{k - 1}$, defined as follows: if $X_1, \dots, X_{k - 1}$ are vector fields, and
$$Y := (\iota_{X_1} \cdots \iota_{X_{k - 1}} \alpha)^\sharp$$
is the vector field dual to the contraction of $\alpha$, then
$$\langle \nabla^\alpha T, X_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes X_k\rangle := \nabla_Y T.$$
We think of $\nabla^\alpha T$ as a sort of ``weighted projection'' of $\nabla T$ to the subbundle $\ker \star \alpha \subset TM$.

\begin{proposition}
Suppose that $F_p$ are $C^1$ $p$-tight forms converging to a tight form $F$.
Furthermore suppose that as $p \to \infty$, $\|F_p\|_{C^{1 + \alpha}} \lesssim 1$.
Then $F \in C^1$ and 
\begin{equation}\label{infty Max}
\begin{cases}
\dif F = 0, \\
\langle \nabla^F F, F\rangle = 0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

We should clarify the PDE (\ref{infty Max}): $\nabla^F F$ is a section of $\Omega^{d - 1} \otimes \Omega^{d - 2}$, so its contraction with $F$ is the contraction of the $\Omega^{d - 1}$ part with $F$; thus $\langle \nabla^F F, F\rangle$ is a $d - 2$-form.
If $d = 2$, and $F = \dif u$, then (\ref{infty Max}) is exactly the $\infty$-Laplace equation 
$$\langle\nabla^2 u, \nabla u \otimes \nabla u\rangle = 0.$$

\begin{proof}
We first compute from (\ref{pMaxwell}) that $\dif F = 0$ and
\begin{align*}
0
&= \dif(|F_p|^{p - 2} \star F_p) \\
&= \dif(|F_p|^{p - 2}) \wedge \star F_p + |F_p|^{p - 2} \dif \star F_p \\
&= (p - 2) |F_p|^{p - 4} \langle \nabla F_p, F_p\rangle \wedge \star F_p + |F_p|^{p - 2} \dif \star F_p.
\end{align*}
If $F_p$ is nonzero, then we can divide through by $(p - 2) |F_p|^{p - 4}$ to get
\begin{equation}\label{intermediate p Max}
0 = \langle\nabla F_p, F_p\rangle \wedge \star F_p + \frac{|F_p|^2}{p - 2} \dif \star F_p.
\end{equation}
At the zeroes of $F_p$, we simply observe that (\ref{intermediate p Max}) holds for trivial reasons.

By assumption $||F_p|^2 \dif \star F_p| = o(p)$, so as $p \to \infty$, the second term of (\ref{intermediate p Max}) drops out.
We can take the limit of (\ref{intermediate p Max}) using the equicontinuity of $\nabla F_p$ to get
$$0 = \langle \nabla F, F \rangle \wedge \star F.$$
Taking the Hodge star of both sides, we get (\ref{infty Max}).
\end{proof}

Like other papers on $L^\infty$ variational problems \cite{Barron08,Sheffield12,daskalopoulos2022}, we are not aware of a suitable notion of weak solution of (\ref{infty Max}).
One possible candidate are Katzourakis' \dfn{contact solutions} \cite{Katzourakis2018OnAV}, but even the basic problem of showing that a tight form is a contact solution of (\ref{infty Max}) seems quite challenging.
We regard the problem of finding a suitable notion of weak solution as the most important problem posed in this work, as it is likely that such a notion would also be a viable candidate notion of weak solution for $\infty$-harmonic maps.\footnote{Throughout this section, we take the convention that $\infty$-harmonic maps are based on the operator norm as in \cite{Sheffield12, daskalopoulos2022}, and not on the Frobenius norm as in \cite{Ou12}. This convention is necessary in order than $\infty$-harmonic maps minimize their Lipschitz constants.}
We caution, however, that (\ref{infty Max}) is significantly easier to work with than the PDE for $\infty$-harmonic maps given by Sheffield and Smart \cite{Sheffield12}, since the PDE for $\infty$-harmonic maps is not even defined on every smooth map.

\subsection{Geometric and variational interpretations of the Euler-Lagrange equation}\label{EL interpretation}
The PDE (\ref{infty Max}) has a simple geometric interpretation, which generalizes the interpretation of the $\infty$-Laplace equation as asserting that the gradient curves of an $\infty$-harmonic function are lines.

\begin{proposition}\label{infty Max calibrates}
Let $F$ be a $C^1$ solution of (\ref{infty Max}) with no zeroes, and let $N$ be a connected integral hypersurface of $\ker \star F$.
Then there exists $\lambda > 0$ such that $N$ is an $F/\lambda$-calibrated hypersurface.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $(X_1, \dots, X_{d - 1})$ be an orthonormal frame of vector fields tangent to $N$.
We then introduce the tensor field
$$T_i := X_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \widehat{X_i} \otimes \cdots \otimes X_{d - 1},$$
where the hat means to remove that factor.
By definition of $N$, and the fact that $F$ has no zeroes, $F$ is a nonzero scalar field $\lambda$ times $\dif S_N$.
So $\iota_{X_1} \cdots \widehat{\iota_{X_i}} \cdots \iota_{X_{d - 1}} F$ is a nonzero scalar field $u_i$ times $X_i^\flat$.
Applying (\ref{infty Max}), we have 
$$0 = \langle \langle \nabla^F F, F\rangle, T_i\rangle = u_i \langle \nabla_{X_i} F, F \rangle = \frac{u_i}{2} \partial_{X_i} (|F|^2).$$
Since $u_i/2$ is nonzero, we see that $|F|^2$ is constant along integral curves of $X_i$.
Since $(X_1, \dots, X_{d - 1})$ spans the tangent bundle of $N$, we conclude that $|F|^2$ is constant along $N$, or equivalently that $\lambda$ is a constant.
Therefore $\dif S_N = F/\lambda$ is closed, hence $N$ is $F/\lambda$-calibrated.
\end{proof}

We now give a variational criterion for (\ref{infty Max}).
Unfortunately, the converse is weaker than we would like, because in order to apply arguments similar to those of \cite{Aronsson67,Sheffield12} we need to assume that $\ker(\star F)$ is a singular integrable distribution.

\begin{proposition}
Let $F$ be a $C^1$ closed $d - 1$-form, and suppose that for every $V \subseteq M$ such that $H^{d - 1}(V, \RR) = 0$, and every $U \Subset V$,
\begin{equation}\label{ABC inequality}
\Comass_U(F) \leq \|F\|_{C^0(\partial U)}.
\end{equation}
Then (\ref{infty Max}) holds.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
It suffices to prove (\ref{infty Max}) locally, so we can cover $M$ by open balls $V$ with $H^{d - 1}(V, \RR) = 0$ and prove that (\ref{infty Max}) holds in slightly smaller balls.
Since $H^{d - 1}(V, \RR) = 0$, we can find a $C^2$ $d - 2$-form $A$ on a neighborhood of $\overline V$ with $\dif A = F$.
Also for $\xi$ a covariant tensor of valence $d - 1$ at $x$, let $\xi^{\rm as}$ be its antisymmetrization, and
$$f(x, \xi) := |\xi^{\rm as}|_{g^{-1}(x)}^2.$$

We first claim that for any $d - 2$-form $B$, $f(\cdot, B) = |\dif B|^2$.
Since $\nabla$ is torsion-free, antisymmetrization annihilates the Christoffel symbols of $\nabla$, so if $\nabla^\flat$ denotes a flat connection, then $(\nabla B)^{\rm as} = (\nabla^\flat B)^{\rm as}$; the latter is of course $\dif B$.
Thus in particular, $f(\cdot, A) = |F|^2$.

Let $W \Subset V$ be obtained by slightly shrinking $V$.
We claim that $A|_W$ is an absolute minimizer of $f(x, \nabla A(x))$ in the sense of \cite[Definition 5.1]{Barron2001}.
In other words, we claim that for each open $U \subseteq W$ with smooth boundary and each covariant tensor field $B$ of valence $d - 2$, such that $A - B$ has compact support in $U$,\footnote{Strictly speaking, the definition of absolute minimizer ranges over all open sets $U$ ($\Omega'$ in the notation of \cite{Barron2001}), not just those with smooth boundary; similarly one requires the competition class to range over traceless (rather than compactly supported) variations. However, it is trivial to modify the proof of \cite[Theorem 5.2]{Barron2001} to only require smooth domains and compactly supported variations.}
$$\sup_{x \in U} f(x, A(x)) \leq \sup_{x \in U} f(x, B(x)).$$
To see this, let $G = (\nabla B)^{\rm as}$, so that by (\ref{ABC inequality}),
\begin{align*}
\sup_{x \in U} f(x, A(x))
&= \Comass_U(F) \leq \|F\|_{C^0(\partial U)} = \|G\|_{C^0(\partial U)} \leq \|G\|_{C^0(U)} = \sup_{x \in U} f(x, B(x)).
\end{align*}

By the above claims and \cite[Theorem 5.2]{Barron2001}, for each $x \in W$, we have the Euler-Lagrange-Aronsson equation that for any $d - 2$-form $\theta$,
\begin{align*}
0 
&= \left\langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial \xi}(x, \nabla A(x)), \nabla \left[f(x, \nabla A(x))\right] \otimes \theta(x)\right\rangle \\
&= 2\langle (\nabla A(x))^{\rm as}, \nabla(|(\nabla A(x))^{\rm as}|^2) \otimes \theta(x)\rangle \\
&= 2\langle F(x), \nabla(|F(x)|^2) \otimes \theta(x)\rangle.
\end{align*}
Since $\nabla$ is a metric connection, $\nabla(|F|^2) = 2\langle \nabla F, F\rangle$.
Thus we have 
$$0 = 4\langle F, \langle \nabla F, F\rangle \otimes \theta\rangle = 4\langle \langle \nabla^F F, F\rangle, \theta\rangle$$
and since $\theta$ was arbitrary we conclude (\ref{infty Max}).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{tight and integrable implies infinity maxwell}
Let $F$ be a $C^1$ solution of (\ref{infty Max}) such that $\ker(\star F)|_{F \neq 0}$ is an integrable distribution.
Then for every $x \in M$ and every sufficiently small $r > 0$, (\ref{ABC inequality}) holds for $U = B(x, r)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First observe that if $x \in M$ and $F(x) = 0$, then $|F|$ has a local minimum at $x$, so for any $y$ sufficiently close to $x$, say $y \in B(x, r)$, $|F|$ does not have a local maximum at $y$ (unless $y$ is also a local minimum, hence $F(y) = 0$); therefore (\ref{ABC inequality}) holds.
Henceforth we assume that $F(x) \neq 0$.

Let $r > 0$ be such that $F|_{B(x, r)}$ has no zeroes and for some $s > r$, $H^{d - 1}(B(x, s), \RR) = 0$.
Let $\mathscr F$ be the foliation of $B(x, r)$ obtained by integrating $\ker(\star F)$.
By definition of $s$, we may assume that $F = \dif A$ for some $d - 2$-form $A$ defined on $B(x, s)$.
By Proposition \ref{infty Max calibrates}, for each leaf $N$ of $\mathscr F$ there exists $\lambda_N > 0$ such that for each hypersurface $N'$ with $N \cap \partial B(x, r) = N' \cap \partial B(x, r)$,
$$\lambda_N \Mass(N) = \int_N F = \int_{N \cap \partial B(x, r)} A = \int_{N' \cap \partial B(x, r)} A = \int_{N \cap \partial B(x, r)} F \leq \lambda_N \Mass(N'),$$
so $N$ is absolutely area-minimizing in $B(x, r)$ and hence meets $\partial B(x, r)$, say at some point $x_N$.
Moreover, $F|_N$ has constant comass $\lambda_N$; since $\mathscr F$ is a foliation it holds that for each $x \in V$ there exists a leaf $N \ni x$ of $\mathscr F$, and then 
\begin{align*}
|F(x)| &= |F(x_N)| \leq \|F\|_{C^0(\partial B(x, r))}. \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Failure of global absolute minimality}\label{nonintegrability}
Let us show that Proposition \ref{tight and integrable implies infinity maxwell} cannot be improved to hold for every open set (as opposed to simply for small balls), and that minimality fails completely in the absence of integrability.
This is in stark contrast to the case of $\infty$-harmonic functions on euclidean space, which are absolutely minimizing for the Lipschitz constant on every open set \cite{Crandall2008}.

We begin by showing that (\ref{ABC inequality}) can fail on large open sets.
The map we study here has a crucial role in the proof that the generic $\infty$-harmonic map between hyperbolic surfaces only attains its Lipschitz constant on the canonical lamination \cite{daskalopoulos2022}.
However, this defect in the theory seems to be generic to $L^\infty$ variational systems.
One can use the failure of the Kirszbraun-Valentine theorem \cite[Example 9.6]{Gu_ritaud_2017}, for example, to show that any homothetic contraction $u: \Hyp^2 \to \Hyp^2$ is $\infty$-harmonic but is not absolutely minimizing Lipschitz.\footnote{However, $u$ is absolutely minimizing for the closely related functional $\mathcal F_\infty$ defined in \cite{Crandall2008}.}

\begin{example}
Consider the cylinder $M := \Sph^1_\theta \times \RR_x$ with the hyperbolic metric
$$g := \dif x^2 + \frac{\cosh^2 x}{4} \dif \theta^2.$$
Then $M$ has a single closed geodesic $\gamma$, which winds around $\{x = 0\}$, and has circumference $\pi$.
Let $\theta: M \to \Sph^1$ be the projection map, so
$$|\dif \theta|(x, \theta) = 2 \sech x.$$
This attains its maximum on $\gamma$, and if $U$ is any neighborhood of $\gamma$, then $|\dif \theta|_{\overline U}|$ attains its maximum on the interior of $U$, violating (\ref{ABC inequality}).
In particular, $\theta$ is not absolutely minimizing Lipschitz.

Using the Christoffel symbols
\begin{align*}
{\Gamma^\theta}_{\theta \theta} &= {\Gamma^\theta}_{x x} = 0, \\
{\Gamma^\theta}_{x \theta} &= {\Gamma^\theta}_{\theta x} = \tanh x,
\end{align*}
we see that
$$\nabla \dif \theta = \tanh x \dif x \dif \theta,$$
and hence $\Delta_\infty \theta = 0$.
This implies that $\dif \theta$ solves (\ref{infty Max}).\footnote{A similar argument shows that $\theta$ is harmonic, hence is $p$-harmonic for every $p \in [2, \infty]$. This can be used to show that $\dif \theta$ is tight.}
\end{example}

The above example relied on a judicious choice of $F = \dif \theta$ which calibrated a closed geodesic.
In particular, $\mathscr D := \ker(\star \dif \theta)$ was integrable.
By taking $\mathscr D$ to be orthogonal to a Beltrami field with constant eigenvalue, we show that the integrability hypothesis is needed even for global minimality:

\begin{example}\label{integrability needed}
Let $V$ be the unit vertical vector to the Hopf fibration 
$$\Sph^1 \to \Sph^3 \to \Sph^2.$$
Let $\mathscr D$ be the distribution of horizontal vectors.
The vertical and horizontal directions are orthogonal, so if we set $F := \star V^\flat$, and let $X, Y$ be an orthonormal frame for $\mathscr D$, then $F(X, Y) = 1$ and $F$ annihilates vertical vectors.
In particular $|F| = 1$ identically, so $2\langle \nabla F, F\rangle = \dif(|F|^2) = 0$.

But $V$ is a Beltrami field whose eigenvalue is identically $2$ \cite[\S3]{Peralta_Salas_2023}, in the sense that
$$\nabla \times V = 2V.$$
Since $(\nabla \cdot) \circ (\nabla \times) = 0$, it follows that $\nabla \cdot V = 0$, so $\dif F = 0$.
Therefore $F$ solves (\ref{infty Max}) and, since $H^2(\Sph^3, \RR) = 0$, $F$ is exact.

Thus $F$ is a solution which is cohomologous to $0$ and nonzero.
It follows that $F$ cannot have best comass and cannot be tight.
\end{example}

\appendix
\section{Geometric measure theory}\label{GMT appendix}
\subsection{Notation}
Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold.
The operator $\star$ is the Hodge star on $M$, thus $\star 1$ is the Riemannian measure of $M$.
We denote the musical isomorphisms by $\sharp, \flat$.
To avoid confusion, we write $H^\ell$ for de Rham cohomology, but never a Sobolev space, which we instead denote $W^{\ell, p}$.
The manifold $\Ball^d$ is the unit ball in $\RR^d$, $\Sph^d$ is the unit sphere in $\RR^{d + 1}$, and $\Hyp^d$ is the hyperbolic space.
The sheaf of $\ell$-forms is denoted $\Omega^\ell$, and the sheaf of closed $\ell$-forms is denoted $\Omega^\ell_{\rm cl}$.
We assume that $\ell$-forms are $L^1_\loc$, but \emph{not} that they are continuous; hence $\dif$ must be meant in the sense of distributions.
The $\delta$-dimensional Hausdorff measure is $\mathcal H^\delta$, normalized so that if $\delta$ is an integer, then $\mathcal H^\delta$ is $\delta$-dimensional Riemannian measure.

Let $\mathscr F$ be a presheaf, whose sections have components which are functions.
If, for every compactly supported smooth function $\chi$, $\chi u$ is a section of $\mathscr F$, we say that $u$ is a section of $\mathscr F_\loc$.
Moreover, $\mathscr F$ is the presheaf of compactly supported sections of $\mathscr F$.
If $\mathcal X$ is a function space, we write $\mathcal X(\cdot, \mathscr F)$ for the sheaf of sections of $\mathscr F$ with components in $\mathcal X$.

We write $A \lesssim_\theta B$ to mean that $A \leq CB$, where $C > 0$ is a constant that only depends on $\theta$.
We write $A \ll_\theta B$ to mean that, as $B \to 0$, $A \to 0$, where the rate of convergence only depends on $\theta$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Homological integration}
By an $\ell$-\dfn{current of locally finite mass} $T$ we mean a continuous linear functional on the space $C^0_\cpt(M, \Omega^\ell)$ of continuous $\ell$-forms of compact support.
By a \dfn{current} we shall always mean a current of locally finite mass, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
We write $\int_M T \wedge \varphi$ for the dual pairing of a current and a form.
If $T$ is a current (of locally finite mass), then the components of $T$ are Radon measures, and conversely a Radon measure is a $0$-current.

A closed $\ell$-current $T$ defines a homology class $[T] \in H_\ell(M, \RR)$.
However, every closed $d - \ell$-form $\varphi$ with compact support defines a compactly supported \emph{cohomology} class $[\varphi] \in H^{d - \ell}_\cpt(M, \RR)$, as well as an $\ell$-current $\varphi \mapsto \int_M \psi \wedge \varphi$, which then defines a homology class in $H_\ell(M, \RR)$.
This can be confusing! 
But, recall that the Poincar\'e duality map 
$$\PD: H^{d - \ell}_\cpt(M, \RR) \to H_\ell(M, \RR)$$
(we also write $\PD$ for the inverse map) is induced by the map which sends the class of a form $\varphi$ to the class of the current induced by $\varphi$, a fact that we shall frequently use without comment.
We shall mainly be interested in closed manifolds, so we have a natural ring isomorphism $H^\bullet_\cpt(M, \RR) = H^\bullet(M, \RR)$.

We say that an open set $U \subseteq M$ is a \dfn{deformed euclidean ball} if there is a bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphism $U \cong \Ball^d$.
By $C^{1-}$ we mean the Fr\'echet space which is the intersection of all H\"older spaces $C^\alpha$, $\alpha \in [0, 1)$.

\begin{proposition}[Poincar\'e's lemma with elliptic regularity]\label{Hodge theorem}
Suppose that $U$ is a deformed euclidean ball, $\ell \in \{1, \dots, d\}$, and $F \in L^\infty(U, \Omega^\ell_{\rm cl})$.
Then there exists $A \in C^{1-}(U, \Omega^{\ell - 1})$ such that $\dif A = F$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By the main theorem of \cite{Costabel2010}, there exists a solution operator $T$ of the equation $\dif A = F$ such that for any $1 < p < \infty$, $T$ is a bounded linear map
$$L^p(U, \Omega^\ell_{\rm cl}) \to W^{1, p}(U, \Omega^{\ell - 1}).$$
The result now follows from the Sobolev embedding theorem if we take $p$ large enough.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{portmanteau}
Let $(\mu_n)$ be a sequence of positive Radon measures with $\mu_n(X) \lesssim 1$, and $\mu$ a positive Radon measure, on a compact metrizable space $X$.
Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mu_n \weakto^* \mu$.
\item $\liminf_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(X) \geq \mu(X)$, and for every closed $Y \subseteq X$, $\limsup_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(Y) \leq \mu(Y)$.
\item $\limsup_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(X) \leq \mu(X)$, and for every open $U \subseteq X$, $\liminf_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(U) \geq \mu(U)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
After rescaling so that $\mu_n(X) \leq 1$ for every $n$, this follows from \cite[Theorem 13.16]{klenke2013probability}.
\end{proof}

Let $v$ be a $d - 1$-covector over $\RR^d$.
Then $(\star v)^\flat \in \RR^d$, and we may assume that it lies in the span of the coordinate vector $\partial_{x^d}$.
But then $v$ lies in the span of $\dif x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \dif x^{d - 1}$, and it follows that the comass of $v$ is $|v|$.
In particular, for any $F \in L^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$,
$$\|F\|_{L^\infty} = \Comass(F),$$
a fact that we shall use without comment throughout.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Anzellotti's pairing}
We are going to appeal to results of Anzellotti \cite{Anzellotti1983}, which were formulated in the gradient-divergence-curl formalism of vector calculus on euclidean space.
In fact, these results can be formulated in terms of differential forms, after which they become manifestly invariant under bi-Lipschitz changes of coordinates.
To demonstrate the reformulation process, we go through the details of the construction of the Anzellotti wedge product in the language of differential forms, and then leave the details of the other reformulations to the reader.

\begin{definition}
Let $u \in BV(M, \RR)$ and $F \in L^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$.
Assume that $\dif F \in L^d$.
Then the \dfn{Anzellotti wedge product} of $\dif u$ and $F$ is the distribution $\dif u \wedge F$, such that for every test function $\chi \in C^\infty_\cpt(M, \RR)$,
$$\langle \dif u \wedge F, \chi\rangle := -\int_M \chi u \wedge \dif F - \int_M \dif \chi \wedge u \wedge F.$$
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{Anzellotti wedge product exists}
Let $u \in BV(M, \RR)$, $F \in L^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$, and $\dif F \in L^d$.
Then the Anzellotti wedge product $\dif u \wedge F$ is well-defined as a distribution.
In fact, $\dif u \wedge F$ is a Radon measure, and 
\begin{equation}\label{Anzellotti Holder inequality}
\Mass(\dif u \wedge F) \leq \Comass(F) \Mass(\dif u).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We follow the proof of \cite[Theorem 1.5]{Anzellotti1983}.
By the Sobolev embedding theorem for $BV$ \cite[\S5.6]{evans2015measure}, $u \in L^{\frac{d}{d - 1}}$, the dual space of $L^d$.
Therefore for every $\chi \in C^\infty_\cpt(M)$, $\langle \dif u \wedge F, \chi\rangle$ is finite, so $\dif u \wedge F$ is well-defined as a distribution.

Suppose that $\supp \chi \Subset U$ for some $U \Subset M$.
If $u$ is sufficiently smooth, then an integration by parts gives 
$$|\langle \dif u \wedge F, \chi\rangle| = \left|\int_M \chi \dif u \wedge F\right| \leq \Comass(F) \|\chi\|_{C^0} \Mass_U(\dif u)$$
where $\Mass_U$ denotes the mass \emph{computed in $U$}.
In general, we can find a sequence $(u_n) \subset C^\infty$ such that $u_n \weakto^* u$ in $BV$.
Then $u_n \weakto u$ in $L^{\frac{d}{d - 1}}$ and $\dif u_n \weakto^* \dif u$ as currents of locally finite mass.
Since we are testing $\dif u$ against the $L^d$ form $\chi F$,
$$|\langle \dif u \wedge F, \chi\rangle| \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} |\langle \dif u_n \wedge F, \chi\rangle| \leq \Comass(F) \|\chi\|_{C^0} \liminf_{n \to \infty} \Mass_U(\dif u_n).$$
But, by Proposition \ref{portmanteau},
$$\liminf_{n \to \infty} \Mass_U(\dif u_n) \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \Mass_{\overline U}(\dif u_n) \leq \Mass(\dif u)$$
which gives the desired estimate (\ref{Anzellotti Holder inequality}), since we only used the $C^0$ norm of $\chi$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[trace theorem {\cite[Theorem 1.2]{Anzellotti1983}}]\label{integration is welldefined}
Let $\iota: N \to M$ be the inclusion of an oriented Lipschitz hypersurface.
Let $\mathcal X$ be the space of $F \in L^\infty(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$ such that the components of $\dif F$ are Radon measures.
Then the pullback $\iota^*$ of $d - 1$-forms extends to a bounded linear map
$$\iota^*: \mathcal X \to L^\infty(N, \Omega^{d - 1})$$
satisfying the estimate
\begin{equation}\label{integral over chain is linfinity}
	\|\iota^* F\|_{L^\infty(N)} \leq \|F\|_{L^\infty(M)}.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

A measurable set $U \subseteq M$ has \dfn{locally finite perimeter} if $1_U \in BV_\loc$.
The \dfn{measure-theoretic boundary} of $U$ is the set $\partial U$ of $x \in M$ such that for all $\varepsilon > 0$,
$$0 < \Mass(U \cap B(x, \varepsilon)) < \Mass(B(x, \varepsilon)).$$
Then $\partial U$ is an integral $d - 1$-current (in particular, the sum of Lipschitz hypersurfaces), with surface measure $\star |\dif 1_U|$; moreover, $\dif 1_U$ is conormal to $\partial U$ \cite[Theorem 4.4]{Giusti77}.
See also \cite[Appendix A]{BackusCML} for a discussion of related issues in our setting; in particular, we assert that without loss of generality, we may assume that $\partial U$ is closed.
The superlevel sets $\{u > \lambda\}$ of a function $u \in BV_\loc(M, \RR)$ have locally finite perimeter \cite[Theorem 1.23]{Giusti77}.

\begin{proposition}[coarea formula]\label{coarea theorem}
Let $u \in BV_\loc(M, \RR)$, $F \in L^\infty_\loc(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$, and $\chi \in C^0_\cpt(M, \RR)$.
If $\dif F \in L^d_\loc$, then
\begin{equation}\label{coarea formula}
\int_M \chi \dif u \wedge F = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{\partial \{u > \lambda\}} \chi F \dif \lambda.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
After identifying $\dif 1_U$ with the integral current $\partial U$, this follows from \cite[Proposition 2.7(ii)]{Anzellotti1983}.
\end{proof}

\section{Derivation of the dual equations}\label{duality derivation}
We are interested in deriving the duality equation (\ref{strong duality}) and the PDE for a $p$-tight form (\ref{p tight}) from the duality theorem for convex optimization.
This is not strictly necessary for the proofs of the main theorems of this paper, but they probably seem unmotivated without it.
Indeed, Thurston's conjecture prescribes the use of ``the max flow min cut principle, convexity, and $L^0 \leftrightarrow L^\infty$ duality'' -- and convex duality is a sort of grand generalization of the max flow min cut principle.

We follow \cite[Chapter IV]{Ekeland99}.
For a reflexive Banach space $X$, we denote by $\hat X$ its dual.
If $I: X \to \RR \cup \{+\infty\}$ is a convex function, we introduce its \dfn{Legendre transform}, the convex function
\begin{align*}
	\hat I: \hat X &\to \RR \cup \{+\infty\}\\
	\xi &\mapsto \sup_{x \in X} \langle \xi, x\rangle - I(x).
\end{align*}
We identify the cokernel of a linear map with the kernel of its adjoint.

\begin{theorem}[convex duality]\label{abstract convex analysis}
Let $\Lambda : X \to Y$ be a bounded linear map between reflexive Banach spaces.
Let $I: Y \to \RR \cup \{+\infty\}$ satisfy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $I$ and $\hat I$ are strictly convex,
\item $I$ is lower semicontinuous,
\item if $|y| \to \infty$ in $Y$, then $I(y) \to +\infty$, and 
\item there exists a point $x \in X$ such that $I$ is continuous and finite at $\Lambda(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a minimizer $\underline x \in X$ of $I(\Lambda(x))$, unique modulo $\ker \Lambda$.
\item There exists a unique maximizer $\overline \eta$ of $-\hat I(-\eta)$ subject to the constraint $\eta \in \coker \Lambda$.
\item We have \dfn{strong duality}
\begin{equation}\label{abstract strong duality}
I(\Lambda(\underline x)) = -\hat I(-\overline \eta).
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is largely a special case of \cite[Chapter IV, Theorem 4.2]{Ekeland99}.
Let $\mathscr P, \mathscr P^*$ be as in the statement of that theorem.
Then $\mathscr P$ is the problem of minimizing $J(x, \Lambda x)$ where $J(x, y) := I(y)$.
The Legendre transform of $J$ satisfies 
$$\hat J(\xi, \eta) = \begin{cases} \hat I(\eta), & \xi = 0, \\
	+\infty, &\xi \neq 0,
\end{cases}$$
and $\mathscr P^*$ is the problem of maximizing
$$-\hat J(\Lambda^* \eta, -\eta) = \begin{cases}
	-\hat I(-\eta), &\eta \in \ker \Lambda^*, \\
	-\infty, &\eta \notin \ker \Lambda^*,
\end{cases}$$
where $\Lambda^*$ is the adjoint of $\Lambda$.
Then most of the various assertions of this theorem follow immediately from \cite[Chapter IV, Theorem 4.2]{Ekeland99}.
The fact that $\overline \eta \in \coker \Lambda$ follows from the facts that $\overline \eta$ is a solution of $\mathscr P^*$, but any solution of $\mathscr P^*$ must be a member of $\ker \Lambda^*$. 
To establish uniqueness, we use \cite[Chapter II, Proposition 1.2]{Ekeland99}, the fact that $\hat I$ is strictly convex, and the fact that we may view $I \circ \Lambda$ as a strictly convex function on the reflexive Banach space $X/\ker \Lambda$.
\end{proof}

Let $M$ be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold with fundamental group $\Gamma$ and universal cover $\tilde M \to M$.
Let $\alpha \in \Hom(\Gamma, \RR)$ be a representation, which, as always, we identify with the harmonic $1$-form representing the image of $\alpha$ under the Hurcewiz map.

\begin{theorem}[convex duality for the $q$-Laplacian]\label{mfmc qLaplacian}
Let $\alpha \in \Hom(\Gamma, \RR)$.
Then there is an $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic function,
which is unique modulo constants.
Furthermore, there is a minimizer $F$ of 
$$J_{p, \alpha}(F) := \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p - \int_M \alpha \wedge F$$
among all closed $d - 1$-forms on $M$.
Moreover, $F$ is the unique closed $d - 1$-form such that
\begin{equation}\label{strong duality appendix}
	\frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p + \int_M \dif u \wedge F = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $X$ be the space of $W^{1, q}_\loc(\tilde M)$ functions $u$ which are $\Gamma$-equivariant, and let $Y := L^q(M, \Omega^1)$.
We identify $\hat Y$ with $L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$ using the perfect pairing 
\begin{align*}
	L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1}) \times Y &\to \RR \\
	(F, \varphi) &\mapsto \int_M \varphi \wedge F.
\end{align*}
Then $\Lambda := (\dif: X \to Y)$ is a bounded linear map, and the $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-Laplacian is the Euler-Lagrange equation of $I \circ \Lambda$, where $I$ is the strictly convex functional such that
$$I(\varphi) := \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\varphi|^q$$
if $\varphi$ is cohomologous to the harmonic $1$-form $\alpha$, and $I(\varphi) := +\infty$ otherwise.

Let
$$I_\alpha(\psi) := \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\psi + \alpha|^q,$$
defined for exact $L^q$ $1$-forms $\psi$, thus $\widehat{I_\alpha}$ is defined on the space of $L^p$ $d - 1$-forms modulo the kernel of the map
$$F \mapsto \left(\psi \mapsto \int_M \psi \wedge F\right)$$
and we lift it to $L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$.

Let $v$ be a primitive of $\alpha$.
Then an $\alpha$-equivariant $u$ minimizes $I$ iff $u - v$ minimizes $I_\alpha \circ \Lambda$, which happens iff $u$ is $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic.
Since $I_\alpha(\psi) = I_0(\psi + \alpha)$, we can apply \cite[Chapter I, Remark 4.1]{Ekeland99} to see that $I_\alpha$ and $\widehat{I_\alpha}$ are strictly convex and
$$\widehat{I_\alpha}(F) = \widehat{I_0}(F) - \int_M \alpha \wedge F = \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p - \int_M \alpha \wedge F.$$
Since $\coker \Lambda$ is the space of closed $L^p$ $d - 1$-forms on $M$, for $F \in \coker \Lambda$, $\widehat{I_\alpha}(F)$ does not depend on the choice of representatives $\alpha, v$, or of the lift of $\widehat{I_\alpha}$ to $L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$.

Next we observe that $\ker \Lambda$ is the space of constants, and for any $\alpha$-equivariant $u$ and closed $F$,
\begin{align*}
I(\Lambda u) + \widehat{I_\alpha}(-F)
&= \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p + \int_M \alpha \wedge F \\
&= \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p + \int_M \dif u \wedge F.
\end{align*}
All of the assertions of this proposition now follow from Theorem \ref{abstract convex analysis}.
\end{proof}

Let $u$ be an $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic function, and let 
\begin{equation}\label{dual solution appendix}
F := -|\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u.
\end{equation}
This $d - 1$-form is clearly closed, since $u$ is $q$-harmonic.
Since
$$(p - 2)(q - 1) + (q - 2) = 0,$$
we have 
$$\dif(|F|^{p - 2} \star F) = \pm \dif(|\dif u|^{(p - 2)(q - 1)} |\dif u|^{q - 2} \dif u) = \pm \dif \dif u = 0$$
where the sign depends on the dimension $d$.
Thus $F$ solves the PDE 
\begin{equation}\label{pMaxwell}
\begin{cases}
	\dif F = 0 \\
	\dif^* (|F|^{p - 2} F) = 0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Moreover, $F$ satisfies (\ref{strong duality appendix}) (since $\dif u$ is cohomologous to $\alpha$) so $F$ is the unique minimizer of $J_{p, \alpha}$.
Thus we have proven:

\begin{corollary}
Let $u, F$ be as in Theorem \ref{mfmc qLaplacian}.
Then $F$ is $p$-tight, and we have the pointwise duality relation (\ref{dual solution appendix}).
\end{corollary}

Finally, let us observe that when $d = 2$, we can locally write $F = \dif v$ for a function $v$.
Then (\ref{dual solution appendix}) is the equation for the conjugate $q$-harmonic that was studied by Daskalopolous and Uhlenbeck \cite[\S3]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
If, in addition, $p = q = 2$, then (\ref{dual solution appendix}) is exactly the Cauchy-Riemann equation.
So it is reasonable to view (\ref{dual solution appendix}) as a higher-dimensional and nonlinear generalization of the Cauchy-Riemann equation.
