\begin{abstract}
We introduce a family of closed $d-1$-forms on Riemannian $d$-manifolds which minimize their comass (or $L^\infty$ norm) in their cohomology class, which we call \dfn{tight}.
Tight forms have properties similar to (gradients of) $\infty$-harmonic maps between surfaces: they are convex duals of $1$-harmonic functions and attain their comass on a measured oriented minimal lamination $\mu$.
We show that $\mu$ has properties analogous to a measured sublamination of Thurston's canonical lamination.

\section{Introduction}
The classical \dfn{max flow min cut theorem} asserts that in a discrete flow network $\mathcal G$, the maximal flow through $\mathcal G$ is equal to the \dfn{minimal cut} of $\mathcal G$, namely the minimal total capacity of any set of edges which divide $\mathcal G$ into a source component and a sink component; this theorem is a concrete form of the duality theorem for convex optimization.
As we shall survey below, various continuous versions of the max flow min cut theorem have since appeared, which usually replace the maximal flow by a \dfn{calibration} (a closed $d - 1$-form, or equivalently a divergence-free vector field, of $L^\infty$ norm $1$), and the minimal cut by a minimal submanifold.
In particular, Bangert and Cui have shown that given a continuous calibration $F$, there exists a minimal lamination calibrated by $F$ \cite[Theorem 5.1]{bangert_cui_2017}.

We shall prove a particularly strong version of the Bangert--Cui max flow min cut theorem on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $\leq 4$.
We only need to assume that the calibration $F$ is measurable; moreover, it shall follow from our methods that the calibrated lamination is Lipschitz.
We use the approach of $p$-harmonic duality which was pioneered by Daskalopolous and Uhlenbeck in the context of best Lipschitz maps \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse,daskalopoulos2022,daskalopoulos2023}.
To be more precise, we pick out a special class of calibrations, which we call \dfn{tight forms}, which are the variational solutions of a suitable generalization of the $\infty$-Laplace equation.
Tight forms are necessarily convex duals of $1$-harmonic functions, and as $1$-harmonic functions induce minimal laminations \cite[Theorem C]{BackusCML}, the main theorem follows.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Max flow min cut theorems}
So that we may compare it with its continuous form, we recall the classical max flow min cut theorem \cite[Chapter 7]{umesh2006algorithms}.
A \dfn{flow network} $\mathcal G = (G, c, s, t)$ consists of a finite directed graph $G$, a \dfn{capacity} $c: E(G) \to \RR_+$ on the edges of $G$, a \dfn{source} vertex $s \in V(G)$, and a \dfn{sink} vertex $t \in V(G)$.
A \dfn{flow} through $\mathcal G$ is a function $f: E(G) \to \RR_+$ such that for each vertex except $s, t$, the sum of $f(e)$ over incoming edges $e$ equals the sum of $f(e)$ over the outgoing edges $e$; we write $\|f\|$ for the sum of $f(e)$ over edges $e$ leaving $s$.
A \dfn{cut} of $G$ is a partition $V(G) = S \sqcup T$ such that $s \in S$ and $t \in T$; $\|(S, T)\|$ is the sum over all edges $e$ from $S$ to $T$ of $c(e)$. \todo{Make better notation}

\begin{theorem}[max flow min cut, graphs]
Let $\mathcal G$ be a flow network. Then 
$$\max_f \|f\| = \min_{(S, T)} \|(S, T)\|.$$
In particular, if $f$ is a maximal flow and $(S, T)$ is a minimal cut, then $\|(S, T)\|$ equals the sum of $f(e)$ over all edges $e$ from $S$ to $T$.
\end{theorem}

Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ diffeomorphic to $\Sph^{d - 1} \times [-1, 1]$ (for example), and a scale $0 < \varepsilon \ll 1$, we can discretize $M$ at scale $\varepsilon$ to get a flow network, where most of the vertices are tiles at scale $\varepsilon$, but the source $s$ is the entire sphere $\Sph^{d - 1} \times \{-1\}$ and the sink $t$ is the other sphere $\Sph^{d - 1} \times \{+1\}$.
Then a flow corresponds to a divergence-free vector field (which for our purposes will be more convenient to view as a closed $d - 1$-form) of $L^\infty$ norm $1$ and a cut corresponds to a hypersurface which partitions $M$ into two open sets, one containing $s$ and the other $t$.
If $C$ is any cut, $\overline C$ is a minimal cut, and $F$ is a flow, then by Stokes' theorem and the triangle inequality,
\begin{equation}\label{one sided max flow min cut}
\int_C F = \int_{\overline C} F \leq |\overline C|.
\end{equation}
Thus the sum of any flow over any cut is bounded by the size of a minimal cut.
We refer to \cite[Appendix A]{Freedman_2016} for a more precise version of the above discretization.
\todo{Draw a picture of this}

The continuous max flow min cut theorem is the assertion that the bound (\ref{one sided max flow min cut}) is sharp: the sum of the max flow over any cut must equal the area of a minimal cut.
In other words, the continuous max flow min cut theorem asserts that we can find a closed $d - 1$-form $F$ such that $\|F\|_{L^\infty} = 1$ and for any cut $C$,
$$\int_C F = |\overline C|.$$

A form of the above sketchy theorem was established by Federer \cite[\S4.15]{Federer1974}.
In the modern formulation of Federer's theorem, we introduce the stable norm on homology:

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{stable norm} $\Mass(\sigma)$ of a homology class $\sigma \in H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ is the infimum of the mass $\Mass(N)$ among all representative chains $N$.
The \dfn{costable norm} $\Comass(\rho)$ of a cohomology class $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ is the infimum of $\|F\|_{L^\infty}$ among all representative forms $F$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[max flow min cut, Federer's version]\label{Federer}
Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold and $\sigma \in H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
Then there exists a cohomology class $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ such that $\Comass(\rho) \leq 1$, and 
$$\Mass(\sigma) = \langle \rho, \sigma\rangle.$$
\end{theorem}

In particular, if we interpret representatives of $\sigma$ is ``cuts'', a closed minimal hypersurface representing $\sigma$ is a minimal cut.
Meanwhile, a representative $d - 1$-form $F$ of $\rho$ such that $\|F\|_{L^\infty} = \Comass(\rho)$ is a maximal flow.
By a doubling argument, Theorem \ref{Federer} implies the max flow min cut theorem for $M \cong \Sph^{d - 1} \times [-1, 1]$ outlined above, at least under the nondegeneracy condition that there is a closed minimal hypersurface homologous to a boundary component which does not meet $\partial M$ and has strictly less area than either boundary component.
For this reason, we shall henceforth content ourselves to consider closed manifolds, and leave the doubling arguments for manifolds with boundary to the reader.

Federer's theorem has found myriad applications, including in computational geometry \cite{sullivan1990crystalline} and string theory \cite{Freedman_2016}; both references here observe that Federer has essentially proven a max flow min cut theorem.
Under the assumption $d \leq 4$, our main theorem implies Theorem \ref{Federer}.

Another form of the max flow min cut theorem was introduced by Thurston in his work on best Lipschitz maps \cite{Thurston98}.
A \dfn{best Lipschitz map} $u$ is a map which minimizes its Lipschitz constant, among all maps homotopic to $u$.
Thurston's motivation was to define a Finsler metric on the Teichm\"uller space $\widetilde{\mathscr M_g}$: the \dfn{Thurston asymmetric distance} between two hyperbolic structures on a closed surface $S$ of genus $g \geq 2$ is the Lipschitz constant of a best Lipschitz map homotopic to $\id_S$.
Thurston's asymmetric metric is a particularly appealing geometry on $\widetilde{\mathscr M_g}$ because of its intimate connection with the structure of geodesic laminations on hyperbolic surfaces \cite{Thurston98, Gu_ritaud_2017}:

\begin{theorem}[max flow min cut, Thurston's version]\label{existence of thurston lamination}
Let $f: M \to N$ be a homeomorphism of closed hyperbolic surfaces.
Then there exists a best Lipschitz map $u$ homotopic to $f$, and a measured geodesic lamination $\mu$ on $M$, such that $\mu$ pushes forward to a measured geodesic lamination on $N$, and
\begin{equation}\label{L is K}
	\Lip(u) = \frac{\Mass(u_* \mu)}{\Mass(\mu)} = \sup_\lambda \frac{\Mass(u_* \lambda)}{\Mass(\lambda)},
\end{equation}
the supremum taken over all measured laminations $\lambda$ on $M$.
\end{theorem}

Thurston established Theorem \ref{existence of thurston lamination} in a tour de force of geometric topology, but he conjectured that a proof of his result ``should be feasible with a simpler proof based on more general principles -- in particular, the max flow min cut principle, convexity, and $L^0 \leftrightarrow L^\infty$ duality'' \cite[Abstract]{Thurston98}.

Theorem \ref{existence of thurston lamination} does not follow from our main theorem; however, the analogous result for maps from closed hyperbolic surfaces to $\Sph^1$, which was proven by Daskalopolous and Uhlenbeck \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, is a corollary of our main result.
The main idea of \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse} is that a special class of best Lipschitz maps are the $\infty$-harmonic maps, which in turn are dual to $1$-harmonic functions (or equivalently, geodesic laminations).
In fact, we closely follow \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse} for much of the proof, as we also heavily use $p$-harmonic maps to $\Sph^1$.
As Daskalopolous and Uhlenbeck have given a proof of a version of Theorem \ref{existence of thurston lamination} using similar methods \cite{daskalopoulos2022,daskalopoulos2023}, it may be possible to adapt our results to manifold-valued maps.

The statement in the literature that we are aware of, which is closest to our main theorem, is due to Bangert and Cui \cite{bangert_cui_2017}.
To emphasize the analogy with best Lipschitz maps, we call a form \dfn{best comass} if it minimizes its comass:

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{comass} of a closed $d - 1$-form $F$ is $\|F\|_{L^\infty}$.
A form $F$ is \dfn{best comass} if it minimizes its comass among all forms cohomologous to $F$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{calibration} is a measurable closed $d - 1$-form $F$, such that $\|F\|_{L^\infty} = 1$.
Given a calibration $F$, a hypersurface $N$ is $F$-\dfn{calibrated} if the pullback of $F$ to $N$ is the area form on $N$.
\end{definition}

Observe that a best comass form is a calibration iff the costable norm of its cohomology class is $1$.
Moreover, the fundamental theorem of calibrated geometry \cite{Harvey82} asserts that every $F$-calibrated hypersurface $N$ is minimal, and in fact homologically area-minimizing if $N$ is closed.
With these preliminaries in mind, we may now state the Bangert--Cui theorem \cite[Theorem 5.1]{bangert_cui_2017}:

\begin{theorem}[max flow min cut, Bangert and Cui's version]\label{BangertCui}
Let $F$ be a continuous best comass calibration on a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $\leq 7$.
Then there exists a measured oriented minimal lamination $\lambda$ such that every leaf of $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated.
In particular, 
$$\Mass(\lambda) = \langle [\lambda], [F]\rangle.$$
\end{theorem}

The idea of Theorem \ref{BangertCui} is to use Theorem \ref{Federer} to find a homology class $\sigma$ dual to $[F]$, and then consider a minimizing representative $\lambda$ of $\sigma$, so that $\Mass(\lambda)$ is the stable norm of $\sigma$.
However, most calibrations which appear in nature are measurable and not necessarily continuous \cite[\S1]{bangert_cui_2017}, and it is natural to restrict attention to \emph{Lipschitz} laminations \cite[Remark 2.3]{bangert_cui_2017}; thus, a more natural formulation of Theorem \ref{BangertCui} would not require that $F$ is continuous, and would assert that $\lambda$ is Lipschitz.

A more serious flaw with Theorem \ref{BangertCui} is that a key ingredient in its proof is the structure theorem for locally minimal $d - 1$-currents.
This theorem was announced by Auer and Bangert \cite{Auer01} but its proof has not appeared, though Victor Bangert has kindly allowed me to view a draft proof.
I recently established a similar result to the structure theorem \cite[Theorem C]{BackusCML} by somewhat different methods, which also gives the Lipschitz regularity; this motivated me to prove a stronger version of Theorem \ref{BangertCui} without any gaps.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Tight forms and $1$-harmonic functions}{Tight forms and one-harmonic functions}}
We shall prove a version of Theorem \ref{BangertCui} using Daskalopolous and Uhlenbeck's method of $p$-harmonic maps to $\Sph^1$, which they introduced in their work on best Lipschitz maps to $\Sph^1$ \cite{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
The idea is to consider $d - 1$-forms which behave analogously to $p$-harmonic functions, and take the limit $p \to \infty$ to get a best comass form which behaves analogously to an $\infty$-harmonic function.
At the same time we consider the convex dual problem.
The best comass forms will be ``maximal flows''; their dual ``minimal cuts'' will be $1$-harmonic functions.

To be more precise, let $(p, q)$ be a H\"older pair (thus $1/p + 1/q = 1$) such that $d < p < \infty$.
Motivated by the $p$-Laplace equation $\dif^*(|\dif v|^{p - 2} \dif v) = 0$, we introduce \dfn{$p$-tight} forms, which are closed $d-1$-forms which solve the system of PDE
$$\dif^*(|F|^{p - 2} F) = 0.$$
Given a $p$-tight form, the $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant function $u$ on the universal cover such that
$$\dif u = (-1)^{d - 1} |F|^{p - 2} \star F$$
is $q$-harmonic -- in other words, $u$ is a solution of the $q$-Laplace equation 
$$\dif^*(|\dif u|^{q - 2} \dif u) = 0.$$
Our first theorem constructs a best comass form, and a dual $1$-harmonic function, by taking limits of $p$-tight forms and their dual $q$-harmonic functions.

\begin{mainthm}\label{existence of infinity tight forms}
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ be a cohomology class.
Let $(F_p, u_q)$ be the family of dual pairs of $p$-tight forms and $q$-harmonic functions, suitably normalized, with $[F_p] = \rho$ and $(p, q)$ ranging over H\"older pairs with $d < p < \infty$.
Then there exists a pair $(F, u)$ such that as $p \to \infty$ along a subsequence, $F_p \to F$ weakly in $L^r$ for any $d < r < \infty$, and $u_q \to u$ weakly in $BV$, with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ has best comass.
\item $u$ is $1$-harmonic.
\item The product of distributions $\dif u \wedge F$ is well-defined.
\item We have the duality relation
\begin{equation}\label{max flow mean cut}
\Comass(\rho) \star |\dif u| = \dif u \wedge F.
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{mainthm}

This is a combination of Propositions \ref{existence infinity} and \ref{existence 1}.
We call the best comass form $F$ an \dfn{$\infty$-tight} form, or simply a \dfn{tight} form.

We highlight the max flow min cut-type formula (\ref{max flow mean cut}) as the main point of the theorem.
It is crucial to the proof that $u$ is $1$-harmonic, and allows us to prove this without a careful analysis of the limiting behavior of $q$-harmonic functions as in \cite[Theorem 2.4]{Mazon14}, or of $p$-tight forms as in \cite[\S6]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
On the other hand, if $\Comass(\rho) = 1$, then we shall be able to use (\ref{max flow mean cut}) to show that the level sets of $u$ are $F$-calibrated.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Calibration of the measured stretch lamination}
Suppose that $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ satisfies $\Comass(\rho) = 1$.
If we knew that every tight representative $F$ of $\rho$ was continuous, then it would follow from the Bangert--Cui theorem that $F$ calibrates a minimal lamination.
However, a proof that tight forms are continuous is out of reach.\footnote{For domains in $\RR^2$, $\infty$-tight forms are $C^\alpha$ \cite{Evans08}, but it is unlikely that this argument generalizes.}
On the other hand, we know by my previous work \cite[Theorem C]{BackusCML} that the level sets of a $1$-harmonic function form a measured oriented Lipschitz minimal lamination.

\begin{definition}
Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $2 \leq d \leq 4$, and $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
We can define a measured oriented minimal lamination $\mu$, by considering a tight representative $F$ of $\rho$, letting $u$ be a dual $1$-harmonic function to $F$, and letting $\mu$ be the lamination induced by $u$.
We call $\mu$ a \dfn{measured stretch lamination} associated to $\rho$.
\end{definition}

Our main theorem is the combination of Propositions \ref{MCL contains Thurston} and \ref{L equals K}, and follows easily from (\ref{max flow mean cut}) and the theory of \cite{BackusFLG, BackusCML}.
It characterizes the measured stretch lamination as a lamination which is maximally stretched in the sense of (\ref{L is K}).
To state the theorem, we let $[\lambda]$ denote the homology class of a measured oriented lamination $\lambda$.

\begin{mainthm}\label{lams are calibrated}
Suppose that $M$ is a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $d \leq 4$.
Let $\mu$ be a measured stretch lamination associated to $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$, and let $F$ be a form of best comass representing $\rho$.
Then $\mu$ is $F/\Comass(\rho)$-calibrated.
Moreover, for $\lambda$ ranging over measured oriented laminations,
\begin{equation}\label{duality between stable and comass}
\Comass(\rho) = \sup_\lambda \frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle}{\Mass(\lambda)} = \frac{\langle \rho, [\mu]\rangle}{\Mass(\mu)}.
\end{equation}
\end{mainthm}

Every measured stretch lamination is homologically area-minimizing, and conversely, every homology class contains a measured stretch lamination.
From these considerations, we see that Theorem \ref{Federer} is a corollary of Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated}.

\subsection{Outline of the paper}
\todo{Fix this}

In \S\ref{comass sec}, we outline the basic properties of the comass, and the geometric measure theory needed for the problem at hand.

In \S\ref{tight forms sec}, we construct the $\infty$-tight form in each cohomology class, and its $1$-harmonic conjugate, proving Theorem \ref{existence of infinity tight forms}.
We also state a few natural conjectures about $\infty$-tight and $p$-tight forms which we shall not address here.

In \S\ref{MCL sec}, we study the maximum comass locus of a form of best comass, and the measured stretch lamination associated to its cohomology class.
By applying the results of the previous two sections, we prove Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated}.

\section{Summary of \texorpdfstring{\cite{BackusFLG,BackusCML}}{previous results}}
\subsection{Geometric measure theory}
\todo{Get rid of known FLG stuff, and make $d \leq 7$ instead of $d \leq 4$}
To fix notation and conventions we recall some well-known geometric measure theory.
We also shall recall some technicalities which we established in \cite{BackusFLG}.

The sheaf of $\ell$-forms is denoted $\Omega^\ell$.
We assume that $\ell$-forms are $L^1_\loc$, but \emph{not} that they are continuous; hence $\dif$ must be meant in the sense of distributions.
To avoid confusion, we write $H^\ell$ for de Rham cohomology, but \emph{never} a Sobolev space (which shall only be denoted by $W^{\ell, p}$), nor a Hausdorff measure (which shall be denoted $\mathcal H^\ell$).
We let $\dif V = \star 1$ be the volume form on $M$, and for an $\ell$-rectifiable set $\tau$, we let $\dif S_\tau := \dif \mathcal H^\ell|_\tau$.

An \dfn{$\ell$-blade} is the wedge product $v = v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_\ell$ of vectors $v_1, \dots, v_\ell$.
The \dfn{comass} $|\varphi|$ of an $\ell$-covector $\varphi$ is the supremum of $\langle \varphi, v\rangle/|v|$, taken over all nonzero $\ell$-blades.

By an $\ell$-\dfn{current of locally finite mass} $T$ we mean a continuous linear functional on the space $C^0_\cpt(M, \Omega^\ell)$ of continuous $\ell$-forms of compact support.
We write $\int_M T \wedge \varphi$ for the dual pairing of a current and a form.
The duality norm of $T$ is its \dfn{mass}, namely for an open set $U \subseteq M$,
$$\Mass_U(T) := \sup_{\substack{\supp \varphi \Subset U \\ \|\varphi\|_{C^0} \leq 1}} \int_U T \wedge \varphi.$$
We write $\Mass(T) := \Mass_M(T)$.
If $T$ represents a simplex $\sigma$, then $\Mass(T)$ is the surface area of $\sigma$.
If $\dif T$ is an $\ell - 1$-current of locally finite mass, we say that $T$ is \dfn{locally normal}.
In particular, a locally normal $d$-current is the same thing as a function of locally bounded variation, and a locally normal $0$-current is the same thing as a signed Radon measure.

We showed that the null set in the statement of the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, when applied to a section of a trivialized tensor bundle, does not depend on the choice of trivialization \cite[Proposition 2.1]{BackusFLG}:

\begin{proposition}\label{invariance of LDT}
Let $F$ be a $L^1_\loc$ section of a tensor bundle over $M$, and let $\mu$ be a Radon measure on $M$.
Then there exists a diffeomorphism-invariant $\mu$-null set $Z \subset M$ such that for any coordinate system on $M$, any multiindex $I$, and any $x \notin Z$,
$$F_I(x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{1}{\mu(B_r(x))} \int_{B_r(x)} F_I(y) \dif \mu(y).$$
\end{proposition}

Suppose that an open set $U \subset M$ has \dfn{locally finite perimeter} in the sense that its indicator function $1_U$ has locally bounded variation.
Then $U$ has a \dfn{reduced boundary} $\partial^* U$, the set of points at which the conormal $1$-form to $\partial^* U$ exists.
We carefully wrote down the coarea formula at this level of regularity on curved domains \cite[Proposition 2.5]{BackusFLG}:

\begin{proposition}\label{coarea}
For any function $u \in BV_\loc(M)$ and open set $U \subset M$ with smooth boundary,
$$\Mass_U(\dif u) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\partial^* \{u > \lambda\} \cap U| \dif \lambda.$$
\end{proposition}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$1$-harmonic functions}{One-harmonic functions} and minimal laminations}
We now recall the correct formulation of weak solutions to the $1$-Laplace equation 
$$\dif^*\left(\frac{\dif u}{|\dif u|}\right) = 0$$
which we introduced in \cite{BackusCML}.
The formulation essentially says that $\dif u/|\dif u|$ locally looks like a coclosed $d-1$-current, even if $|\dif u|$ is a singular Radon measure.

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{$1$-harmonic function} on $M$ is a function $u \in BV_\loc(M)$ such that we can cover $\supp u$ by open sets $U_\alpha$ equipped with measurable vector fields $X_\alpha$ satisfying
\begin{equation}\label{local calibration}
\begin{cases}
\|X_\alpha\|_{L^\infty} \leq 1 \\
\nabla \cdot X_\alpha = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
and such that as Radon measures on $U_\alpha$,
$$(\dif u, X_\alpha) = |\dif u|.$$
\end{definition}

There need not exist a global vector field $X$ satisfying (\ref{local calibration}); the indicator function of the northern hemisphere in $\Sph^2$ is $1$-harmonic, but does not admit such a vector field $X$ by the divergence theorem.
Thus this definition is the ``sheafification'' of the definition due to Maz\'on, Rossi, and Segura de Le\'on \cite{Mazon14}.
On the other hand, (\ref{local calibration}) asserts that the flux $F_\alpha := \star X_\alpha^\flat$ of $X_\alpha$ is a calibration on $U_\alpha$.

\begin{definition}
Let $B$ be a ball in $M$.
A function $u \in BV(B)$ has \dfn{least gradient} in $B$ if $u$ minimizes its total variation in the sense that for every function $v \in BV_\cpt(B)$,
$$\Mass_B(\dif u) \leq \Mass_B(\dif u + \dif v).$$
A function has \dfn{locally least gradient} if one can cover $M$ by balls in which $u$ has least gradient.
\end{definition}

By \cite[Theorem 1.1]{Mazon14}, a function is $1$-harmonic iff it has locally least gradient.
The de Giorgi--Miranda regularity theorem asserts that if $1_E$ has least gradient in a ball in $\RR^d$, $d \leq 7$, then $\partial E$ is smooth \cite[Theorem 10.11]{Giusti77}.
We carefully wrote down the details of the de Giorgi--Miranda theorem on Riemannian manifolds \cite[Theorem 1.1]{BackusCML}.
The one main new idea is an estimate on the parallel propagator, which allows us to define the oscillation of a differential form in an approximately coordinate-invariant way; once this has been established, the proof is similar to \cite{Giusti77}.

\begin{theorem}
Let $E \subset M$ be open, suppose that $d \leq 7$, and suppose that $1_E$ has least gradient.
Then $E$ is bounded by smooth embedded stable minimal hypersurfaces.
\end{theorem} 

We also want a geometric formulation of $1$-harmonic functions.
Thus we turn to the theory of laminations.
Fix an interval $I \subset \RR$ and a box $J \subset \RR^{d - 1}$.

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{laminar flow box} is a $C^0$ coordinate chart $f: I \times J \to M$ and a compact set $K \subseteq I$, such that for every $k \in K$, $F|_{\{k\} \times J}$ is a $C^1$ embedding, and the \dfn{leaf} $F(\{k\} \times J)$ is a $C^1$ complete hypersurface in $F(I \times J)$.
Two laminar flow boxes belong to the same \dfn{laminar atlas} if the transition maps between them send leaves to leaves.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{lamination} is a closed subset $S \subseteq M$, called its \dfn{support}, and a maximal laminar atlas $\mathscr A$, such that $S$ is the union of the leaves of $\mathscr A$.
A \dfn{foliation} is a lamination $\lambda$ with $\supp \lambda = M$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A lamination is
\begin{enumerate}
\item \dfn{Lipschitz} if its flow boxes are Lipschitz isomorphisms,
\item \dfn{oriented} if its transition maps are orientation-preserving, and
\item \dfn{minimal} if its leaves are minimal hypersurfaces.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Construction of the flow boxes can be quite cumbersome, but it can be done systematically; this is \cite[Theorem A]{BackusCML}.

\begin{theorem}\label{disjoint surfaces are lamination}
Let $\mathcal S$ be a set of disjoint complete minimal hypersurfaces in a manifold $M$ of bounded geometry.
Suppose that for every $N \in \mathcal S$, we have a bound on the second fundamental form 
$$\|\Two_N\|_{C^0} \leq C.$$
Then $\mathcal S$ is the set of leaves of a Lipschitz minimal lamination $\lambda$.
In particular, if $\lambda$ is oriented, then there is a Lipschitz vector field on $M$ whose restriction to each $N \in \mathcal S$ is the normal vector to $N$.
\end{theorem}

We now recall the notion of Ruelle-Sullivan current that was introduced by \cite{Ruelle75} and studied in the context of geodesic laminations in \cite[\S8]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
The motivation of the definition is that if $\lambda$ is a $d - 1$-chain, then $T_\lambda$ is just integration along $\lambda$.

\begin{definition}
A lamination $\lambda$ with atlas $(F_\alpha, K_\alpha)$ is \dfn{measured} if it is equipped with positive Radon measures $\mu_\alpha$ with $\supp \mu_\alpha = K_\alpha$, such that the transition maps $F_\beta^{-1} \circ F_\alpha$ are measure-preserving.
The \dfn{Ruelle-Sullivan current} of a measured oriented lamination $\lambda$ with atlas $(F_\alpha, K_\alpha, \mu_\alpha)$ is the $d-1$-current $T_\lambda$ satisfying, for any partition of unity $(\chi_\alpha)$ subordinate to the open cover $(F_\alpha(I \times J))$,
$$\int_M T_\lambda \wedge \varphi = \sum_\alpha \int_{K_\alpha} \int_{\{k\} \times J} F_\alpha^* (\chi_\alpha \varphi) \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
The \dfn{homology class} $[\lambda]$ and \dfn{mass} $\Mass(\lambda)$ of a measured oriented lamination $\lambda$ are the homology class and mass of its Ruelle-Sullivan current.
\end{definition}

We are now ready to state \cite[Theorem C]{BackusCML}:

\begin{theorem}\label{1 harmonic is MOML}
Suppose that $2 \leq \dim M \leq 4$.
Then a function $u \in BV_\loc(M)$ is $1$-harmonic iff $\dif u$ is the Ruelle-Sullivan current for a measured oriented minimal lamination.
\end{theorem}

\section{\texorpdfstring{$d - 1$-forms}{(d - 1)-forms} of finite comass}\label{comass sec}
In this section we establish some tools from geometric measure theory adapted to closed $L^\infty$ $d - 1$-forms.
Throughout, we fix a Riemannian manifold $M$ (possibly not closed) of dimension $d$ and metric $g$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Local Hodge theory in \texorpdfstring{$L^p$}{Lp}}
The geometric measure theory that we develop in this section relies on the local elliptic regularity of the Hodge system.
Such estimates are standard when $p = 2$ \cite[\S9.5]{taylor2010partial}, but we are mainly interested in the range $d < p < \infty$, where we may apply the Sobolev embedding $W^{1, p} \Subset C^\alpha$.
We thus give a short proof for every $p$.

\begin{lemma}\label{Hodge theorem}
Suppose that there is a bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphism $M \cong \Ball^d$.
Let $1 < p < \infty$, and let $F$ be an $L^p$ closed $\ell + 1$-form.
Then there exists an $\ell$-form $A$ such that $F = \dif A$ and
\begin{equation}\label{Hodge theorem estimate}
\|A\|_{W^{1, p}} \lesssim_p \|F\|_{L^p}.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Without loss of generality, $M = (\Ball^d, g)$ where $g$ is a Riemannian metric of bounded geometry.
Then, possibly after rescaling, the $W^{s, p}(M)$ norm is comparable to the $W^{s, p}(\Ball^d)$ norm.
Everything else in the statement of the lemma is a diffeomorphism invariant, so we may assume that $M = \Ball^d$.
We then solve the elliptic system 
\begin{equation}\label{Hodge Laplacian}
\begin{cases}
	\Delta u = F \\
	u|_{\partial \Ball^d} = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
for an $\ell$-form $u$.
Since $M = \Ball^d$, the Hodge Laplacian commutes with taking components, thus the system (\ref{Hodge Laplacian}) decouples into $\binom d\ell$ elliptic PDE
\begin{equation}\label{decoupled Hodge Laplacian}
\begin{cases}
\Delta(u_I) = F_I \\
u_I|_{\partial \Ball^d} = 0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
one for each $\ell$-index $I$.
By \cite[Chapter 3, Theorem 6.3]{chen1998second}, we have a unique solution to (\ref{decoupled Hodge Laplacian}), which satisfies
$$\|u_I\|_{W^{2, p}} \lesssim_p \|F_I\|_{L^p}.$$
We then let $A := \dif^* u$; then (\ref{Hodge theorem estimate}) holds, and $\dif A = \dif \dif^* u$.
On euclidean space, $\Delta$ and $\dif$ commute, so $\dif u = 0$, and it holds that 
\begin{align*}
\dif A &= (\dif \dif^* + \dif^* \dif) u = \Delta u = F. \qedhere 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

We also need the following result, which essentially asserts that mollification can be chosen to commute with the de Rham differential, at least locally.

\begin{lemma}\label{mollification of closed forms}
Suppose that there is a bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphism $M \cong \Ball^d$.
Let $1 \leq p < \infty$ and let $F$ be an $L^p$ closed $\ell$-form.
Then there exist smooth closed $\ell$-forms $F_n$ such that $F_n \to F$ in $L^p$.
Moreover, if $F \in L^\infty$, then
\begin{equation}\label{heat kernel contracts sup norm}
\limsup_{n \to \infty} \|F_n\|_{C^0} \leq \|F\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Without loss of generality, $M = (\Ball^d, g)$ where $g$ is a Riemannian metric of bounded geometry.
Then, possibly after rescaling, the $L^p(M)$ norm is comparable to the $L^p(\Ball^d)$ norm.
If $\varphi$ is am $\ell$-form and $\chi$ is a function on $\RR^d$, we define the convolution $\chi * \varphi$ by $(\chi * \varphi)_I := \chi * \varphi_I$ for every $\ell$-index $I$.
Every convolution operator commutes with $\dif$, so after convolution with a standard mollifier $\chi_n$ as in \cite[Appendix C, Theorem 6]{evans2010partial}, $F_n := (\chi_n * F)|_{\Ball^d}$ is a closed $\ell$-form and $F_n \to F$ in $L^p(\Ball^d)$ and almost everywhere.

Now suppose that $F \in L^\infty$.
We may choose $\chi_n$ so that $\chi_n \geq 0$, $\int_{\RR^d} \chi_n = 1$, and $\supp \chi_n \Subset B_{1/n}$, the euclidean ball of radius $1/n$ around $0$.
Then 
$$|F_n(x)|_{g(x)} \leq \left|\int_{B_{1/n}} \chi_n(y) F(x - y) \dif y\right|_{g(x)},$$
where the integral is a vector-valued integral (which makes sense since we may view $F$ as a map into $\RR^{\binom d\ell})$.
By the triangle inequality and a Taylor expansion of $g$ around $g(x)$,
\begin{align*}
\left|\int_{B_{1/n}} \chi_n(y) F(x - y) \dif y\right|_{g(x)}
&\leq \int_{B_{1/n}} \chi_n(y) |F(x - y)|_{g(x)} \dif y \\
&= \int_{B_{1/n}} \chi_n(y) |F(x - y)|_{g(x - y)}(1 + O(y)) \dif y \\
&\leq \|F\|_{L^\infty(M)} \int_{B_{1/n}} \chi_n(y)(1 + O(y)) \dif y \\
&= \|F\|_{L^\infty(M)}(1 + O(n^{-1})). \qedhere 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Trace theorem}
We would like to be able to compute the comass of a form $F$ by integration of $F$ along chains.
Unfortunately, $F$ may only be defined almost everywhere, and then it is not clear that such an integral is well-defined; nor is it clear that the cohomology class of $F$ is well-defined (so that the notion of ``best comass'' makes no sense).
Here we show that for closed forms $F$ in $L^p$ and suitable chains $\sigma$, $\int_\sigma F$ is well-defined.



The natural setting for our trace theorem is the integral currents (studied for example in \cite[\S27]{Simon84}), as we shall want to be able to integrate a closed $L^p$ $d - 1$-form along the level sets of a $BV$ function.

\begin{definition}
An $\ell$-current $\sigma$ is \dfn{rectifiable} if there exists an $\ell$-rectifiable set $N$, and a $\dif S_N$-measurable $\ell$-blade field $v$, such that for any $C^0_\cpt$ $\ell$-form $\varphi$,
$$\int_M \sigma \wedge \varphi = \int_N \langle \varphi, v\rangle \dif S_N,$$
and $|v|$ is $\ZZ$-valued.
The rectifiable current $\sigma$ is \dfn{integral} if, in addition, $\dif \sigma$ is rectifiable.
\end{definition}

To emphasize that integral currents $\sigma$ can be represented by rectifiable sets, we write $\partial \sigma := -\dif \sigma$, and $\int_\sigma \varphi := \int_M \sigma \wedge \varphi$.

\begin{lemma}\label{local trace theorem}
Suppose that there is a bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphism $M \cong \Ball^d$.
Let $\tau$ be an integral $d - 1$-current and $\psi \in C^1(M)$.
Then for any $d < p < \infty$, $F \mapsto \int_\tau \psi F$ is a continuous linear function on the space of $L^p$ closed $d - 1$-forms.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
First suppose that $F, G$ are closed $C^1$ $d - 1$-forms, and let $A, B$ be the $d - 2$-forms obtained from Lemma \ref{Hodge theorem}.
By integration by parts and the Sobolev embedding theorem,
\begin{align*}
	\left|\int_\tau \psi(F - G)\right| 
	&\leq \left|\int_{\partial \tau} \psi (A - B)\right| + \left|\int_\tau \dif \psi \wedge (A - B)\right| \\
	&\lesssim_{\tau, \psi} \|A - B\|_{C^0} \lesssim_p \|A - B\|_{L^p} \lesssim_p \|F - G\|_{L^p}.
\end{align*}
If $F, G$ are not necessarily $C^1$, then by Lemma \ref{mollification of closed forms}, the $C^1$ closed $d - 1$-forms are dense in the space of $L^p$ closed $d - 1$-forms, so the desired estimate holds by approximating $F, G$ by $C^1$ closed $d - 1$-forms.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[trace theorem]\label{integration is welldefined}
Let $\tau$ be a compactly supported integral $d-1$-current.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any $d < p \leq \infty$ and $\psi \in C^1(M)$, $F \mapsto \int_\tau \psi F$ extends to a continuous linear functional on the space of $L^p$ closed $d-1$-forms.
\item For any $d < p \leq \infty$, the cohomology class of any $L^p$ closed $d - 1$-form is well-defined.
\item Let $F$ be an $L^\infty$ closed $d - 1$-form. Then for every $\psi \in C^0(M)$,
\begin{equation}\label{integral over chain is linfinity}
	\int_\tau \psi F \leq \|F\|_{L^\infty} \|\psi\|_{L^1(\tau)}.
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We can find a partition of unity $(\chi_\alpha)$ subordinate to an open cover $(U_\alpha)$ such that $U_\alpha$ is bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphic to $\Ball^d$.
Then we may replace $(U_\alpha)$ by a finite subcover $U_1, \dots, U_n$ of a neighborhood of $\supp \tau$.
Applying Lemma \ref{local trace theorem} with $\psi$ replaced by $\psi \chi_k$, we obtain for $F, G$ closed $L^p$ $d - 1$-forms and $p < \infty$,
$$\left|\int_\tau \psi(F - G)\right| \leq \sum_{k = 1}^n \left|\int_\tau \psi \chi_k (F - G)\right| \lesssim_\tau \|F - G\|_{L^p}$$
which gives the continuity in $L^p$.
This also implies that the cohomology is well-defined.

We now handle the case $p = \infty$.
Let $d < q < \infty$ and let $U$ be a small neighborhood of $\supp \tau$; since $\supp \tau$ is compact, if $F, G \in L^\infty$, then $F, G \in L^q(U)$ and 
$$\left|\int_\tau \psi(F - G)\right| \lesssim_\tau \|F - g\|_{L^q(U)} \lesssim_{U, q} \|F - G\|_{L^\infty}.$$
This gives the continuity in $L^\infty$.
We then use Lemma \ref{mollification of closed forms} to find smooth closed $d - 1$-forms $F_{k, m}$ on $U_k$ such that $F_{k, m} \to F|_{U_k}$ in $L^q(U_k)$ and
$$\|F_{k, m}\|_{C^0} \leq \|F\|_{L^\infty}.$$
So by the triangle inequality, if $\psi \in C^1(M)$,
\begin{align*}
\int_\tau \psi F 
&= \sum_{k = 1}^n \int_\tau \psi \chi_k F 
= \sum_{k = 1}^n \lim_{m \to \infty} \int_\tau \psi \chi_k F_{k, m} \\
&\leq \lim_{m \to \infty} \|F_{k, m}\|_{C^0} \int_\tau \psi \sum_{k = 1}^n \chi_k \dif S_\tau 
\leq \|F\|_{L^\infty} \int_\tau \psi \dif S_\tau.
\end{align*}
By approximating a $C^0$ test function $\psi$ by $C^1$ functions, we obtain the result for $\psi \in C^0$.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Coarea formula}
We next seek to make sense of the Radon measure (or $0$-current of locally finite mass) $\dif u \wedge F$ when $u \in BV_\loc(M)$ and $F$ is a closed $L^\infty$ $d - 1$-form.
A priori the expression $\dif u \wedge F$ is nonsensical, as $\dif u$ may fail to be absolutely continuous, while $F$ need not be defined on a Lebesgue null set.


\begin{lemma}\label{reduced level sets are integral currents}
Let $u \in BV(M)$.
Then for almost every $\lambda \in \RR$, integration along the reduced level set $\partial^* \{u > \lambda\}$ defines an integral $d - 1$-current.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{coarea}, for almost every $\lambda \in \RR$, $\{u > \lambda\}$ has locally finite perimeter.
So by the de Giorgi structure theorem \cite[Theorem 14.3]{Simon84}, $\partial^* \{u > \lambda\}$ is an oriented rectifiable $d - 1$-cycle.
So integration along $\partial^* \{u > \lambda\}$ defines a closed rectifiable, and hence integral, $d - 1$-current.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[coarea formula]
Let $u \in BV(M)$, and for each $\lambda \in \RR$, let $\tau_\lambda$ be the reduced level set of $u$.
Then the product $\dif u \wedge F$ with a closed $L^\infty$ $d - 1$-form $F$ can be defined in one and only one way so that for every sequence $(F_n)$ which is bounded in $L^\infty$ and converges in $L^p_\loc$ for some $d < p < \infty$ to a closed $d - 1$-form $F$, $\dif u \wedge F_n \to \dif u \wedge F$ in the weak topology of measures.

Moreover, for every $\chi \in C^0_\cpt(M)$, we have the coarea formula
\begin{equation}\label{coarea formula}
\int_M \chi \dif u \wedge F = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{\tau_\lambda} \chi F \dif \lambda.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Motivated by Proposition \ref{coarea}, it is natural to \emph{define} $\dif u \wedge F$ to be the Radon measure satisfying (\ref{coarea formula}).
If $F$ is continuous, then this will agree with the usual definition of $\dif u \wedge F$ as a product of a Radon measure and a function.
Even if $F$ is discontinuous, (\ref{coarea formula}) defines a Radon measure.
Indeed, let $U \Subset M$ be an open set containing $\supp \chi$.
Then, by the trace theorem, Lemma \ref{reduced level sets are integral currents}, and Proposition \ref{coarea},
$$\left|\int_M \chi \dif u \wedge F\right| \leq \|\chi\|_{C^0} \|F\|_{L^\infty} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \Mass_U(\tau_\lambda) \dif \lambda = \|\chi\|_{C^0} \|F\|_{L^\infty} \Mass_U(\dif u).$$
Therefore $\dif u \wedge F$ is a Radon measure, since it has locally finite mass
$$\Mass_U(\dif u \wedge F) \leq \|F\|_{L^\infty} \Mass_U(\dif u) < \infty.$$

Now we check the convergence on $L^\infty$-bounded sequences in $L^p_\loc$.
Let $\chi \in C^0_\cpt(M)$, let $U \Subset M$ be an open set containing $\supp \chi$, and let $(F_n)$ be an $L^\infty$-bounded sequence converging in $L^p_\loc$ to a closed form $F$.
We introduce the functions
$$f_n(\lambda) := \int_{\tau_\lambda} \chi F_n, \qquad f(\lambda) := \int_{\tau_\lambda} \chi F,$$
which are well-defined by the trace theorem and Lemma \ref{reduced level sets are integral currents}.
Also consider the function $g(\lambda) := \Mass(\tau_\lambda)$, so that for almost every $\lambda \in \RR$, 
$$|f_n(\lambda)| \leq \|F_n\|_{C^0} \|\chi\|_{C^0} g(\lambda) \lesssim \|\chi\|_{C^0} g(\lambda).$$
By Proposition \ref{coarea} and the fact that $u \in BV$, $g \in L^1(\RR)$.
On the other hand, since $F_n \to F$ in $L^p(U)$ and $p > d$, $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere.
So by dominated convergence, $f_n \to f$ in $L^1(\RR)$.
In particular, by Proposition \ref{coarea},
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_M \chi \dif u \wedge F_n
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_n(\lambda) \dif \lambda
= \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(\lambda) \dif \lambda \\
&= \int_M \chi \dif u \wedge F. \qedhere 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Local comass}
We will be interested in the points at which $F$ attains its comass.
One could pose this problem as the problem of computing the locus $\{|F| = \|F\|_{L^\infty}\}$.
However, $|F(x)|$, the comass of the $d - 1$-covector $F(x)$, is both only defined for almost every $x$, and $F$ is not norm-approximable by smooth functions.
So as a proxy for $|F|$, which may fail to be defined on a null set, we use the local comass, which is defined everywhere.

\begin{definition}
For an open set $\Omega \subseteq M$ and a a closed $d - 1$-form $F$, define 
$$\Comass_\Omega(F) := \sup_{\sigma \in \Chain_{d - 1}(\Omega)} \frac{1}{\Mass(\sigma)} \int_\sigma F.$$
The \dfn{local comass} of a closed $d - 1$-form $F$ at $x \in M$ is 
$$\Comass(F, x) = \limsup_{\varepsilon \to 0} \Comass_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(F).$$
\end{definition}

By the trace theorem, $\Comass_\Omega(F)$ is well-defined (but possibly $+\infty$).
Since $\Comass_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(F)$ is a supremum over a set which grows in $\varepsilon$, it is increasing in $\varepsilon$, so the limit superior is actually a limit and an infimum:
$$\Comass(F, x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \Comass_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(F) = \inf_{\varepsilon > 0} \Comass_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(F).$$
In particular, if we write $\Comass(F) := \Comass_M(F)$, then $\Comass(F, x) \leq \Comass(F)$.

The local comass was defined in an analogous manner to the local Lipschitz constant.
As such, it enjoys many of the same properties, including those endowed on the local Lipschitz constant by \cite[Lemma 4.3]{Crandall2008}:

\begin{proposition}\label{crandall}
Let $F$ be a closed $L^\infty$ $d - 1$-form. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The local comass $\Comass(F, \cdot)$ is upper semicontinuous. \label{crandall usc}
\item For almost every $x \in M$, \label{crandall LDT}
$$|F(x)| \leq \Comass(F, x).$$
\item The local comass is bounded, and \label{crandall linfinity}
$$\Comass(F) = \sup_{x \in M} \Comass(F, x) = \|F\|_{L^\infty}.$$
\item If $\sigma \in \Chain_{d - 1}(M)$ then \label{crandall best curl is ABC}
$$\int_\sigma F \leq \Mass(\sigma) \sup_{x \in \sigma} \Comass(F, x).$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We first prove (\ref{crandall usc}).
Let $x^n \to x$ and $r > 0$. Then eventually $x^n \in B_r(x)$, hence $\Comass(F, x^n) \leq \Comass_{B_r(x)}(F)$ and so
\begin{align*}
\limsup_{n \to \infty} \Comass(F, x^n) &\leq \inf_{r > 0} \Comass_{B_r(x)}(F) = \Comass(F, x).
\end{align*}

We now prove (\ref{crandall LDT}).
We may work locally, and choose coordinates $(y^i)$ in which $\sqrt{\det g} = 1$.
Let $I$ be the increasing $d-1$-index with $d$ removed.
By the Lebesgue differentiation theorem and Fubini's theorem, there exists a null set $Z \subset M$, which does not depend on $(y^i)$ by Proposition \ref{invariance of LDT}, such that for every $x \notin Z$,
\begin{align*}
F_I(x) 
&= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{1}{\Mass(B_\varepsilon(x))} \int_{B_\varepsilon(x)} F_I(y) \dif y \\
&= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{1}{\Mass(B_\varepsilon(x))} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{\{y^d = t\} \cap B_\varepsilon(x)} F_I(y) \dif y^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \dif y^{d - 1} \wedge \dif t
\end{align*}
where we used the fact that $\sqrt{\det g} = 1$.
Now $\partial_{y^1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \partial_{y^{d - 1}}$ is the oriented unit $d - 1$-blade tangent to $\{y^d = t\}$, so as forms on $\{y^d = t\}$,
$$F_I(y) \dif y^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \dif y^{d - 1} = F.$$
So
\begin{align*}
F_I(x) 
&= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{1}{\Mass(B_\varepsilon(x))} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{\{y^d = t\} \cap B_\varepsilon(x)} F \dif t \\
&\leq \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{\Comass_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(F)}{\Mass(B_\varepsilon(x))} \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\{y^d = t\} \cap B_\varepsilon(x)| \dif t.
\end{align*}
By Fubini's theorem,
$$F_I(x) \leq \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{\Comass_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(F)}{\Mass(B_\varepsilon(x))} \Mass(B_\varepsilon(x)) = \Comass(F, x).$$
For every $x \in M$ we may select coordinates in which $|F(x)| = F_I(x)$, and then if $x \notin Z$, we conclude that (\ref{crandall LDT}) holds for $x$.

If we combine (\ref{crandall LDT}) with (\ref{integral over chain is linfinity}), then
$$\sup_{x \in M} \Comass(F, x) \leq \Comass(F) \leq \|F\|_{L^\infty} \leq \sup_{x \in M} \Comass(F, x).$$
The inequalities collapse, proving (\ref{crandall linfinity}).
In particular, for each $\sigma \in \Chain_{d - 1}(M)$, we obtain (\ref{crandall best curl is ABC}):
\begin{align*}
\int_\sigma F &\leq \Mass(\sigma) \inf_{\Omega \supset \sigma} \sup_{x \in \Omega} \Comass(F, x) = \Mass(\sigma) \sup_{x \in \sigma} \Comass(F, x). \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $F$ be a closed $L^\infty$ $d - 1$-form.
The \dfn{maximum comass locus} is the set
$$\MCL(F) := \{x \in M: \Comass(F, x) = \Comass(F)\}.$$
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
Suppose that $M$ is a closed manifold and $F$ is a form of best comass.
Then $\MCL(F)$ is a nonempty compact set.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
This is immediate from Proposition \ref{crandall}(\ref{crandall usc}) and the extreme value theorem for upper semicontinuous functions.
\end{proof}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$L^\infty$}{L-infinity} calibrations}
The purpose of this paper is to study calibrated laminations.
If the calibration $F$ is continuous, then the theory of \cite{bangert_cui_2017} of calibrated laminations applies; however, we are not aware of general existence results on continuous calibrations, only $L^\infty$ calibrations, such as \cite[\S4.12]{Federer1974}.
Thus, we now introduce $L^\infty$ calibrations of laminations.

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{calibration} is a closed $d - 1$-form $F$ such that $\Comass(F) = 1$.
An integral $d - 1$-current $\sigma$ is $F$-\dfn{calibrated} if 
$$\Mass(\sigma) = \int_\sigma F.$$
A lamination $\lambda$ is \dfn{$F$-calibrated} if every leaf of $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated.
\end{definition}

The fundamental theorem of calibrated geometry \cite{Harvey82} asserts that a calibrated integral current is homologically area-minimizing (and in particular minimal), so every calibrated lamination is minimal.

It follows from the definitions that if a smooth hypersurface $N$ is $F$-calibrated, then the trace of $F$ along $N$ is the area form $\dif S_N$.
In particular, $F|_N$ is smooth and $N$ is oriented.
If $\lambda$ is an $F$-calibrated lamination, then the trace $F|_\lambda$ is defined to be $F|_N$ along any leaf $N$.
A priori, $\lambda$ could fail to be orientable, and then $F|_\lambda$ would be necessarily discontinuous.
However, we assert that a calibrated lamination is orientable:

\begin{proposition}\label{calibrated implies oriented}
Let $F$ be a calibration and $\lambda$ an $F$-calibrated lamination.
Then $F|_\lambda$ is continuous, and $F$ induces an orientation on $\lambda$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $N$ be a leaf of $\lambda$ and $x \in N$.
Let $\mathscr O$ be the local orientation of $\lambda$ near $x$ which is compatible with $F(x)$. 
We define a $d - 1$-form $G$ by declaring that for $y \in K$ close enough to $x$, $K$ a leaf of $\lambda$, $G(y) = \dif S_K(y)$ is the area form of $K$ with respect to $\mathscr O$.
Then for any $y \in \supp \lambda$ close to $x$, either $F(y) = G(y)$ or $F(y) = -G(y)$; we claim that $F(y) = G(y)$ if $\dist(x, y)$ is small enough.
If this claim is true, then the proposition follows, since $G$ is continuous at $x$.

To prove the claim, we suppose towards contradiction that there is a sequence $(x_n) \subset \supp \lambda$ with $x_n \to x$ and $F(x_n) = -G(x_n)$.
We may write $F = \dif A$ where $A$ is continuous near $x$ by Lemma \ref{Hodge theorem} and the Sobolev embedding theorem.
Let $N_n$ be the leaf of $\lambda$ containing $x_n$; then $N_n$ is minimal, hence smooth, so $F_n|_{N_n}$ is smooth.
Therefore by Stokes' theorem, if $(D_{n, m})$ is a sequence of disks in $N_n$ which shrink down to $x_n$ as $m \to \infty$ and are equipped with the orientation $\mathscr O$,
$$-1 = \lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{1}{\Mass(D_{n, m})} \int_{D_{n, m}} F = \lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{1}{\Mass(D_{n, m})} \int_{\partial D_{n, m}} A.$$
In particular, we can choose $m_n \to \infty$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{orientation contradiction}
\int_{\partial D_{n, m_n}} A \leq 0.
\end{equation}
We set $D_n := D_{n, m_n}$.

Let $(k, z) \in \RR \times \RR^{d - 1}$ be coordinates near $x$ with respect to a flow box, where $k$ indexes the leaves and $z$ is a parameter on each leaf.
Then $D_n = \{k_n\} \times \Omega_n$ for some $\Omega_n \subset \RR^{d - 1}$.
Let $k$ be the index of $N$ and $D_n' := \{k\} \times \Omega_n$.
Since $A$ is continuous, $A(k, z) = A(k_n, z) + o(1)$ as $n \to \infty$, hence
\begin{equation}\label{orientation contradiction 2}
\frac{1}{\Mass(D_n')} \int_{\partial D_n'} A = \frac{1}{\Mass(D_n)} \int_{\partial D_n} A + o(1).
\end{equation}
However, $D_n'$ shrinks down to $x$, and $F(x) = G(x)$, so by Stokes' theorem, for $n$ large,
$$\int_{\partial D_n'} A \gtrsim \Mass(D_n'),$$
hence by (\ref{orientation contradiction}) and (\ref{orientation contradiction 2}),
$$0 < \Mass(D_n) \lesssim \int_{\partial D_n} A \leq 0,$$
a contradiction.
\end{proof}

We next give a natural condition for a lamination to be calibrated.
To make sense of it, observe that if $M$ is closed, $\lambda$ is a lamination, and $F$ is a calibration, then the quantity $\int_M T_\lambda \wedge F$ is well-defined, since it is just the pairing $\langle [F], [\lambda]\rangle$ of cohomology with homology.

\begin{proposition}\label{calibration condition}
Let $F$ be a calibration on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$.
Let $T_\lambda$ be the Ruelle-Sullivan current of a measured oriented lamination $\lambda$.
Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item One has \begin{equation}\label{calibration by Ruelle Sullivan}
\int_M T_\lambda \wedge F = \Mass(\lambda).
\end{equation}
\item $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First suppose that (\ref{calibration by Ruelle Sullivan}) holds.
Let $(\chi_\alpha)$ be a locally finite partition of unity subordinate to an open cover $(U_\alpha)$ of flow boxes for $\lambda$, and let $(\mu_\alpha)$ be the transverse measure.
After refining $(U_\alpha)$ we may assume that $U_\alpha$ is contained in an open set which is bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphic to $\Ball^d$. After shrinking $U_\alpha$ we may assume that $\chi_\alpha > 0$ on $U_\alpha$.
Then for some hypersurfaces $\sigma_{\alpha,k}$,
$$\Mass(\lambda) = \int_M T_\lambda \wedge F = \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha,k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
Let $\dif S_{\alpha,k}$ be the surface measure on $\sigma_{\alpha,k}$. Then
$$\int_M \chi_\alpha \star |T_\lambda| = \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha,k}} \chi_\alpha \dif S_{\alpha,k} \dif \mu_\alpha(k),$$
so summing in $\alpha$, we obtain 
\begin{equation}\label{calibration condition contr}
\sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha,k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k) = \Mass(\lambda) = \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha,k}} \chi_\alpha \dif S_{\alpha,k} \dif \mu_\alpha(k).
\end{equation}

We claim that $\lambda$ is \dfn{almost calibrated} in the sense that for every $\alpha$ and $\mu_\alpha$-almost every $k$, $\sigma_{\alpha, k}$ is calibrated.
If this is not true, then we may select $\beta$ and $K \subseteq I$ with $\mu_\beta(K) > 0$, such that for every $k \in K$, $\int_{\sigma_{\beta, k}} F < \Mass(\sigma_{\beta, k})$.
Since $0 < \chi_\beta \leq 1$ and $F/\dif S_{\beta, k} \leq 1$ on $\sigma_{\beta, k}$, this is only possible if 
$$\int_{\sigma_{\beta, k}} \chi_\beta F < \int_{\sigma_{\beta, k}} \chi_\beta \dif S_{\beta, k}.$$
Integrating over $K$, and using the fact that in general we have $\int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha F \leq \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha \dif S_{\alpha, k}$, we conclude that 
$$\sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k) < \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha \dif S_{\alpha, k} \dif \mu_\alpha(k)$$
which contradicts (\ref{calibration condition contr}).

To upgrade $\lambda$ from an almost calibrated lamination to a calibrated lamination, we first 
given $\sigma_{\alpha, k}$ we choose $k_j$ such that $\sigma_{\alpha, k_j}$ is calibrated and $k_j \to k$.
By Lemma \ref{Hodge theorem}, we can find a $d - 2$-form $A$ with $F = \dif A$ satisfying (\ref{Hodge theorem estimate}), which is then continuous by the Sobolev embedding theorem.
This justifies the following application of Stokes' theorem: 
$$\int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} F = \int_{\partial \sigma_{\alpha, k}} A.$$
Since $k_j \to k$, and $A$ is continuous,
\begin{align*}
\Mass(\sigma_{\alpha, k}) &= \lim_{j \to \infty} \Mass(\sigma_{\alpha, k_j}) = \lim_{j \to \infty} \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k_j}} F = \lim_{j \to \infty} \int_{\partial \sigma_{\alpha, k_j}} A = \int_{\partial \sigma_{\alpha, k}} A = \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} F.
\end{align*}

To establish the converse, suppose that $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated, and let notation be as above.
Since $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated, for every $\alpha$ and every $k$, the area form on $\sigma_{\alpha, k}$ is $F$. Therefore
\begin{align*}
\int_M T_\lambda \wedge F &= \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\sigma_{\alpha, k}} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k) = \Mass(T_\lambda). \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{properties of calibrated laminations}
Suppose that $M$ is a closed Riemannian manifold, $F$ is a calibration, and $\lambda$ is a measured $F$-calibrated lamination.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\lambda$ is minimal.
\item If $G$ is a calibration and cohomologous to $F$, then $\lambda$ is $G$-calibrated.
\item $\supp \lambda \subseteq \MCL(F)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Every leaf of $\lambda$ is $F$-calibrated, hence minimal, so $\lambda$ is also minimal.
Since $\lambda$ is oriented by Proposition \ref{calibrated implies oriented}, it has a Ruelle-Sullivan current.
Then, since (\ref{calibration by Ruelle Sullivan}) only depends on the cohomology class of $F$, not $F$ itself, $\lambda$ is $G$-calibrated.

Now let $S := \MCL(F)$, $N$ a leaf of $\lambda$, and suppose that $x \in N \setminus S$.
Since $S$ is closed, there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B_\varepsilon(x)$ does not meet $S$.
Moreover, $\sigma := N \cap B_\varepsilon(x)$ is a $d-1$-chain in $B_\varepsilon(x)$, so by Proposition \ref{crandall}(\ref{crandall best curl is ABC}),
$$\frac{1}{\Mass(\sigma)} \int_\sigma F \leq \sup_{y \in B_\varepsilon(x)} \Comass(F, y) < \Comass(F) = 1.$$
But then 
$$\int_N F = \int_\sigma F + \int_{N \setminus B_\varepsilon(x)} F < \Mass(\sigma) + \Mass(N \setminus B_\varepsilon(x)) = \Mass(N),$$
so $N$ (hence $\lambda$) is not $F$-calibrated.
\end{proof}

\section{\texorpdfstring{Tight forms and the $1$-Laplacian}{Infinity-tight forms and the one-Laplacian}}\label{tight forms sec}
\subsection{Convex optimization}
We follow \cite{Ekeland99}.
For a reflexive Banach space $X$, we denote by $\hat X$ its dual.
If $I: X \to \RR \cup \{+\infty\}$ is a convex function, we introduce its \dfn{Legendre transform}, the convex function
\begin{align*}
	\hat I: \hat X &\to \RR \cup \{+\infty\}\\
	\xi &\mapsto \sup_{x \in X} \langle \xi, x\rangle - I(x).
\end{align*}
We identify the cokernel of a linear map with the kernel of its adjoint.
In this setting, we have the following form of the convex duality theorem.

\begin{theorem}[convex duality]\label{abstract convex analysis}
Let 
$$\Lambda : X \to Y$$
be a bounded linear map between reflexive Banach spaces.
Let $I: Y \to \RR \cup \{+\infty\}$ satisfy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $I$ and $\hat I$ are strictly convex,
\item $I$ is lower semicontinuous,
\item if $|y| \to \infty$ in $Y$, then $I(y) \to +\infty$, and 
\item there exists a point $x \in X$ such that $I$ is continuous and finite at $\Lambda(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a minimizer $\underline x \in X$ of $I(\Lambda(x))$, unique modulo $\ker \Lambda$.
\item There exists a unique maximizer $\overline \eta$ of $-\hat I(-\eta)$ subject to the constraint $\eta \in \coker \Lambda$.
\item We have \dfn{strong duality}
\begin{equation}\label{abstract strong duality}
I(\Lambda(\underline x)) = -\hat I(-\overline \eta).
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is largely a special case of \cite[Chapter IV, Theorem 4.2]{Ekeland99}.
Let $\mathscr P, \mathscr P^*$ be as in the statement of that theorem.
Then $\mathscr P$ is the problem of minimizing $J(x, \Lambda x)$ where $J(x, y) := I(y)$.
The Legendre transform of $J$ satisfies 
$$\hat J(\xi, \eta) = \begin{cases} \hat I(\eta), & \xi = 0, \\
	+\infty, &\xi \neq 0,
\end{cases}$$
and $\mathscr P^*$ is the problem of maximizing
$$-\hat J(\Lambda^* \eta, -\eta) = \begin{cases}
	-\hat I(-\eta), &\eta \in \ker \Lambda^*, \\
	-\infty, &\eta \notin \ker \Lambda^*,
\end{cases}$$
where $\Lambda^*$ is the adjoint of $\Lambda$.
Then most of the various assertions of this theorem follow immediately from \cite[Chapter IV, Theorem 4.2]{Ekeland99}.
The fact that $\overline \eta \in \coker \Lambda$ follows from the facts that $\overline \eta$ is a solution of $\mathscr P^*$, but any solution of $\mathscr P^*$ must be a member of $\ker \Lambda^*$. 
To establish uniqueness, we use \cite[Chapter II, Proposition 1.2]{Ekeland99}, the fact that $\hat I$ is strictly convex, and the fact that we may view $I \circ \Lambda$ as a strictly convex function on the reflexive Banach space $X/\ker \Lambda$.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Max flow min cut for the \texorpdfstring{$q$-Laplacian}{q-Laplacian}}
We now turn to the problem at hand.
Let $M$ be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold with fundamental group $\Gamma$ and universal covering $\tilde M \to M$, and let $M_{\rm fun} \subset \tilde M$ be a fundamental domain of $\Gamma$.
By Poincar\'e duality and the Hurcewiz theorem, we have canonical isomorphisms
\begin{equation}\label{Poincare Hurcewiz}
H_{d - 1}(M, \RR) = H^1(M, \RR) = \Hom(\Gamma, \RR).
\end{equation}
Sometimes we are interested specifically in integral representations; in that case, we can use the fact that the homotopy type of $\Sph^1$ is $K(\ZZ, 1)$ to further identify 
\begin{equation}\label{Poincare Hurcewiz 2}
H^1(M, \ZZ) = \Hom(\Gamma, \ZZ) = [M, \Sph^1].
\end{equation}

Given a representation
$$\alpha: \Gamma \to \RR,$$
which we always identify with some smooth $1$-form (which we also call $\alpha$) representing the cohomology class corresponding to the representation $\alpha$, and $q \in (1, \infty)$,
we are interested in the $q$-Laplace equation
$$\dif^* (|\dif u|^{q - 2} \dif u) = 0$$
for an $\alpha$-equivariant function $u$ (thus for any $\gamma \in \Gamma$, $u(\gamma(x)) - u(x) = \alpha(\gamma)$).

Let $X$ be the space of $W^{1, q}_\loc(\tilde M)$ functions $u$ which are $\Gamma$-equivariant in the sense that for $\gamma \in \Gamma$, $\gamma^* \dif u = \dif u$, let $Y := L^q(M, \Omega^1)$, and let $p$ be the H\"older conjugate exponent to $q$.
Then $\Lambda := (\dif: X \to Y)$ is a bounded linear map, whose cokernel can be identified with the kernel of
$$\dif: L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1}) \to W^{-1, p}(M)$$
using the perfect pairing 
\begin{align*}
	L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1}) \times Y &\to \RR \\
	(F, \varphi) &\mapsto \int_M \varphi \wedge F 
\end{align*}
to identify $\hat Y$ with $L^p(M, \Omega^{d - 1})$.

One can easily show that the $q$-Laplace equation is the Euler-Lagrange equation of $I \circ \dif$, where $I: Y \to \RR \cup \{+\infty\}$ is defined to be 
$$I(\varphi) := \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\varphi|^q$$
if $\varphi$ is cohomologous to $\alpha$, and otherwise 
$$I(\varphi) := +\infty.$$
Using the methods of \cite[Chapter I, \S4]{Ekeland99} one can show that
$$\hat I(F) = \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p + \int_M \alpha \wedge F$$
defined for $F \in \coker \Lambda$, and the dual problem to the $q$-Laplacian is the problem of maximizing $-\hat I(-F)$.
\todo{Do these computations (maybe in an appendix) so we don't say ``one can show''}

\begin{proposition}[max flow min cut for the $q$-Laplacian]
Given a representation $\alpha: \Gamma \to \RR$, and H\"older conjugate exponents $1 < p, q < \infty$, there exists an $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic function $u: \tilde M \to \RR$, unique modulo constants, and a unique minimizer $F$ of 
$$J_{p, \alpha}(F) := \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p - \int_M \alpha \wedge F$$
among all closed $d - 1$-forms on $M$.
Moreover, we have
\begin{equation}\label{strong duality}
	\frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p = \int_M \dif u \wedge F.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By \cite[Lemma 1]{Loisel_2020}, $I$ and $\hat I$ are both strictly convex.
Moreover, $\coker \Lambda$ is the space of closed $L^p$ $d - 1$-forms on $M$, and $\ker \Lambda$ is the space of constant functions on $\tilde M$.
So the various assertions of this proposition mostly follow from Theorem \ref{abstract convex analysis} and the above discussion.
\end{proof}

Motivated by \cite[\S3.1]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, it is natural to guess that 
\begin{equation}\label{dual solution}
F := |\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u
\end{equation}
is the solution of the dual problem of minimizing $J_{p, \alpha}$.
In order to prove that this is true, we shall need that for H\"older conjugates $1 \leq p, q \leq \infty$,
\begin{equation}\label{holder cancellation}
	(p - 2)(q - 1) + (q - 2) = 0.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}
Suppose that $u: \tilde M \to \RR$ is an $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic function, and suppose that $F$ satisfies (\ref{dual solution}).
Then $F$ is a closed $d - 1$-form, which minimizes $J_{p, \alpha}$ among all closed $d - 1$-forms.
Moreover, $F$ solves the PDE 
\begin{equation}\label{pMaxwell}
\begin{cases}
	\dif F = 0 \\
	\dif^* (|F|^{p - 2} F) = 0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We first show that $\dif F = 0$.
In fact, 
$$\star \dif F = \star \dif(|\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u) = \pm \dif^*(|\dif u|^{q - 2} \dif u) = 0.$$
So by the max flow min cut principle, to prove that $F$ is a minimizer, it suffices to show that (\ref{strong duality}) holds.
One can easily compute 
$$|F|^p = |\dif u|^{(q - 1)p} = |\dif u|^q,$$
so by Stokes' theorem and the fact that $\alpha$ is cohomologous to $\dif u$,
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p&
= \left[\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q}\right] \int_M \star |\dif u|^q
= \int_M \dif u \wedge |\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u \\
&= \int_M \alpha \wedge F.
\end{align*}
Finally, we use (\ref{holder cancellation}) to prove
\begin{align*}
\dif^*(|F|^{p - 2} F) &= \dif^*(|\dif u|^{(p - 2)(q - 1)} |\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u) = \dif^*(\star \dif u) \\
&= \pm \star \dif^2 u = 0. \qedhere 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Regularity of the \texorpdfstring{$q$-Laplacian}{q-Laplacian}}
We now pause to consider two regularity results for the $q$-Laplacian.
The first gives H\"older regularity but is not uniform in $q$; the second is uniform but only gives Sobolev regularity.
The H\"older regularity follows from \cite[Theorem 2]{DIBENEDETTO1983827}:

\begin{lemma}\label{q Laplacian Holder regularity}
Let $u: \tilde M \to \RR$ be an $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic function.
Then $\dif u$ is H\"older continuous.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Suppose that $1 \leq q \leq 2$.
Let $u_q: \tilde M \to \RR$ be an $\alpha$-equivariant $q$-harmonic function.
Then (with constant independent of $q$)
\begin{equation}\label{q Laplacian Sobolev regularity estimate}
\|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} \sim \Mass(\alpha).
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Without loss of generality, $\int_{M_{\rm fun}} \star u_q = 0$.
Let $e_1, \dots, e_k$ be a basis for $H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
This induces a norm $\|\cdot\|$ on $H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ by
$$\left\|\sum_i \beta_i e_i\right\| = \sum_i |\beta_i|,$$
which is comparable to the stable norm $\Mass$ since $H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ is finite-dimensional.
We write $\alpha = \sum_i \alpha_i e_i$.
Let $v_i$ be the $e_i$-equivariant harmonic function such that $\int_{M_{\rm fun}} \star v_i = 0$.
Then $u_2 = \sum_i \alpha_i v_i$, so
$$\|\dif u_2\|_{L^2} \leq \sum_i |\alpha_i| \|\dif v_i\|_{L^2} \lesssim \|\alpha\| \sim \Mass(\alpha).$$
Since $\dif u_q$ is a minimizer of the $L^q$ norm, we estimate using H\"older's inequality 
\begin{align*}
\|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} &\leq \|\dif u_2\|_{L^q} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{2}} \|\dif u_2\|_{L^2} \lesssim \|\dif u_2\|_{L^2} \lesssim \Mass(\alpha).
\end{align*}
In the other direction, we estimate using H\"older's inequality
\begin{align*}
\Mass(\alpha) &\leq \|\dif u_q\|_{L^1} \leq \|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} |M|^{1/p} \lesssim \|\dif u_q\|_{L^q}. \qedhere 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$p$-tight forms}{p-tight forms}}
We next scrutinize the PDE (\ref{pMaxwell}).
If $p = 2$ and $d = 3$, then these equations are exactly the Maxwell equations in vacuum for a static magnetic strength tensor, and the functional $J_2$ below can be interpreted as the magnetic potential energy.
On the other hand, as $p \to \infty$, the solutions of these equations converge to a minimizer of the comass; if $d = 2$, a minimizer of the comass is sometimes called \dfn{tight} \cite{farre23}.
This motivates the below terminology:

\begin{definition}
Let $1 < p < \infty$.
We call the equation (\ref{pMaxwell}) the \dfn{$p$-Maxwell equation}.
A \dfn{$p$-tight form} is a solution of the $p$-Maxwell equation.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose that $M$ is a closed oriented Riemannian manifold.
Then there is a unique $p$-tight form in each cohomology class in $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
Moreover, $p$-tight forms are minimizers of the strictly convex functional
$$J_p(F) := \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F|^p$$
among all forms cohomologous to them.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Strict convexity of $J_p$ on a cohomology class follows from an argument similar to \cite[Lemma 1]{Loisel_2020} and the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer then is a consequence of the direct method of the calculus of variations as in \cite[Chapter II]{Ekeland99}.
To compute the Euler-Lagrange equations for $J_p$, let $B$ be a $d-2$-form (so $F + t \dif B$ is cohomologous to $F$), so that for a minimizer $F$ of $J_p$,
$$\frac{\dif}{\dif t} J_p(F + t \dif B) = \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |F + t \dif B|^p = \int_M \star |F + t \dif B|^{p - 2} \langle F + t \dif B, \dif B\rangle.$$
Setting $t = 0$, we obtain 
$$0 = \int_M \star |F|^{p - 2} \langle F, \dif B\rangle = \int_M \star \langle \dif^*(|F|^{p - 2} F), B\rangle.$$
This equation holds for every $d - 2$-form $B$.
Thus the Euler-Lagrange equations for $J_p$ are (\ref{pMaxwell}).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $F$ be a $p$-tight form, let
\begin{equation}
\dif u := (-1)^{d - 1} |F|^{p - 2} \star F, \label{inverse extremality}
\end{equation}
and let $u$ be the primitive of $\dif u$ on the universal cover $\tilde M$, which is normalized to have zero mean on a fundamental domain $M_{\rm fun}$.
Then $u$ is called the \dfn{$q$-harmonic conjugate} of the $p$-tight form $F$, where $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$.
\end{definition}

Let $u$ be the $q$-harmonic conjugate of $F$.
By Poincar\'e's inequality,
$$\|u\|_{W^{1, q}(M_{\rm fun})}^q \lesssim \int_M \star |\dif u|^q = \int_M \star |F|^{(p - 1)q} = \int_M \star |F|^p < \infty$$
since $F$ is $p$-tight; that is, we have $F \in L^p$ and $u \in W^{1, q}$.

We derived the $p$-Maxwell equation as the dual equation to the $q$-Laplace equation.
We now assert that this process can be inverted.

\begin{lemma}
Let $1 < p, q < \infty$ and $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$.
Let $F$ be a $p$-tight form, and let $u$ be its $q$-harmonic conjugate. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $u$ is $q$-harmonic.
\item One has 
\begin{equation}
F = |\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u. \label{extremality} \\
\end{equation}
\item One has the duality formula (\ref{strong duality}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We first use (\ref{holder cancellation}) to prove
$$|\dif u|^{q - 2} \star \dif u = (-1)^{d - 1} |F|^{(q - 2)(p - 1)} \star \star |F|^{p - 2} F = |F|^{(q - 2)(p - 1) - (p - 2)} F = F.$$
Thus we have (\ref{extremality}), and moreover
$$\dif \star (|\dif u|^{q - 2} \dif u) = \dif F = 0$$
so that $u$ is $q$-harmonic.
We then obtain (\ref{strong duality}) as before. \todo{Write down the details}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Every $p$-tight form is H\"older continuous.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Let $F$ be $p$-tight and let $u$ be its $q$-harmonic conjugate, so $\dif u$ is H\"older continuous by Lemma \ref{q Laplacian Holder regularity}.
The claim now follows from (\ref{extremality}) and the fact that a product of H\"older continuous functions is H\"older continuous.
\end{proof}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Existence of $\infty$-tight forms}{Existence of infinity-tight forms}}
We now take the limit $p \to \infty$ to obtain a privileged form of best comass.
To do so, we shall need the $p$-tight forms to be uniformly bounded in the following sense.

\begin{lemma}
Let $F_p$ be a $p$-tight form, and let $B$ range over closed $d - 1$-forms cohomologous to $F_p$. Then
\begin{equation}\label{infinity magnetic rules p magnetic}
	\|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq |M|^{1/p} \inf_B \|B\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By H\"older's inequality and the fact that $F_p$ is $p$-tight,
$$\|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \|B\|_{L^p} \leq |M|^{1/p} \|B\|_{L^\infty},$$
hence the same holds for the infimum.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{existence infinity}
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
For each $p \geq 2$, let $F_p$ be the $p$-tight form representing $\rho$. Then there exists a closed $d - 1$-form $F$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F_p \to F$ weakly in $L^r$ along a subsequence, for any $d < r < \infty$.
\item $F$ is a best comass representative of $\rho$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We roughly follow \cite[\S3]{Lindqvist14}.
Let $r > d$, and let $B$ be an $L^\infty$ representative of $\rho$.
By H\"older's inequality and (\ref{infinity magnetic rules p magnetic}),
\begin{equation}\label{uniform bounds in p by best curl}
	\|F_p\|_{L^r} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{p}} \|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{r}} \|B\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}
Thus a compactness argument gives $F_p \to F$ for some $d - 1$-form $F$, weakly in $L^r$, and 
$$\|F\|_{L^r} \leq \liminf_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^r} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{r}} \|B\|_{L^\infty}.$$
Diagonalizing, we may assume that $F_p \to F$ weakly in $L^r$ for every such $r$, and taking $r \to \infty$, we conclude 
\begin{equation}\label{infinity magnetics have best curl}
	\|F\|_{L^\infty} \leq \|B\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}
Moreover, $[F] = \lim_{p \to \infty} [F_p] = \rho$.
Since $B$ was arbitrary in (\ref{infinity magnetics have best curl}), $F$ has best comass.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
The $d - 1$-form $F$ of best comass in Proposition \ref{existence infinity} is called a \dfn{tight form}, or an \dfn{$\infty$-tight form}.
\end{definition}

Our next corollary follows immediately from Proposition \ref{existence infinity}, though it can also be proven using Alaoglu's theorem.

\begin{corollary}
Every cohomology class has a best comass representative.
\end{corollary}

The existence of best comass representatives of each cohomology class $\rho$ implies the following useful lemma on the costable norm of $\rho$.

\begin{lemma}\label{p tights approximate L}
Let $F_p$ be the $p$-tight representative of $\rho$. Then 
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^p} = \Comass(\rho).$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We follow \cite[Lemma 2.7]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Let $F$ be a best comass representative of $\rho$, so $\|F\|_{L^\infty} = \Comass(\rho)$.
Since $F_p$ is $p$-tight, H\"older's inequality implies 
$$\|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \|F\|_{L^p} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{p}} \Comass(\rho).$$
Therefore 
$$\limsup_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \Comass(\rho).$$
To prove the converse, suppose that for some $\varepsilon > 0$,
$$\liminf_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^p} \leq \Comass(\rho) - \varepsilon < \Comass(\rho).$$
Along a subsequence which attains the limit inferior, $F_p$ converges weakly in every $L^r$, $d < r < \infty$, to a tight form $\tilde F$ such that (by H\"older's inequality)
$$\|\tilde F\|_{L^r} \leq \liminf_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^r} \leq \liminf_{p \to \infty} |M|^{\frac{1}{r}} \|\tilde F\|_{L^\infty} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{r}} (\Comass(\rho) - \varepsilon).$$
Taking $r \to \infty$, we obtain $\Comass(\tilde F) < \Comass(\rho)$, which contradicts the definition of the costable norm $\Comass(\rho)$.
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$1$-harmonic conjugates of tight forms}{One-harmonic conjugates of tight forms}}
We now construct the $1$-harmonic conjugates of a tight form.
In the special case that the tight form $F$ is a calibration, a $1$-harmonic conjugate will be a $1$-harmonic function on the universal cover whose level sets are calibrated by $F$.

\begin{definition}
Let $F$ be a tight form of cohomology class $\rho$.
A nonconstant $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant $1$-harmonic function $u \in BV_\loc(\tilde M)$ is called a \dfn{$1$-harmonic conjugate} of $F$ if we have the \dfn{max flow min cut principle} that
\begin{equation}\label{1 extremality}
\dif u \wedge F = \Comass(\rho) \star |\dif u|.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

We begin by showing that $L^1$ convergence preserves the equivariance properties of functions.

\begin{lemma}\label{L1 convergence preserves pi1}
Let $\tilde M \to M$ be the universal cover, and let $(u_q)$ be a sequence of $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant functions on $\tilde M$ which converge in $L^1_\loc(\tilde M)$ to a function $u$ as $q \to 1$.
Then $u$ is $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant, and $[u_q] \to [u]$.
Moreover, if $\dif u_q \to \dif u$ in the weak topology of measures on $M$ and $\dif u_q \in L^q$, then
\begin{equation}\label{q to 1 Holder}
\Mass(\dif u) \leq \liminf_{q \to 1} \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $u_q$ is $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant, there exists $\alpha_q \in H^1(M, \RR)$ such that for every $\gamma \in \pi_1(M)$,
\begin{equation}\label{equivariance q}
	\gamma^* u_q = u_q + \langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle.
\end{equation}
Let $M_{\rm fun}$ be a fundamental domain and $U_\gamma := M_{\rm fun} \cup \gamma_* (M_{\rm fun})$.

We claim that $(\alpha_q)$ has a convergent subsequence.
To see this, we first recall that $M$ has finite Betti numbers, so $H^1(M, \RR)$ is locally compact.
Therefore, if no convergent subsequence exists, there exists a $\gamma \in \pi_1(M)$ and a subsequence along which $\langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle \to \infty$.
Moreover, since $u_q \to u$ in $L^1_\loc$, $\|u_q\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})} \leq 2\|u\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})}$ if $q - 1$ is small enough.
But then 
$$\|u_q\|_{L^1(\gamma_* M_{\rm fun})} = \|\gamma^* u_q\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})} \geq \langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle - \|u_q\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})} \geq \langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle - 2\|u\|_{L^1(M_{\rm fun})}$$
and taking $q \to 1$ we conclude that $(u_q)$ is not compact in $L^1(\gamma_* M_{\rm fun})$, contradicting the convergence in $L^1_\loc(\tilde M)$.
So $\alpha_q \to \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in H^1(M, \RR)$ along a subsequence.

For any $q > 1$,
\begin{align*}
\dashint_{M_{\rm fun}} \star |\gamma^* u - u - \langle \alpha, \gamma\rangle| 
&\leq \dashint_{M_{\rm fun}} \star (|\gamma^* u_q - u_q - \langle \alpha_q, \gamma\rangle| + |\gamma^* u_q - u_q| + |\gamma^* u - u|) \\
&\qquad + |\langle \alpha_q - \alpha, \gamma\rangle|.
\end{align*}
Taking $q \to 1$ and applying (\ref{equivariance q}), we conclude that $\|\gamma^* u - u - \langle \alpha, \gamma\rangle\|_{L^1} = 0$, hence $u$ is $\alpha$-equivariant.
Thus $\alpha$ is uniquely defined and $\alpha_q \to \alpha$ along the entire subsequence.

Finally we prove (\ref{q to 1 Holder}).
Suppose that $\dif u_q \to \dif u$ in the weak topology of measures and $\dif u_q$ in $L^q$.
Then
$$\|\dif u_q\|_{L^1} = \Mass(\dif u_q).$$
So we may use the portmanteau theorem and H\"older's inequality to estimate (where $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$)
\begin{align*}
\Mass(\dif u) &= \lim_{q \to 1} \Mass(\dif u_q) \leq \lim_{q \to 1} |M|^{\frac{1}{p}} \|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} = \lim_{q \to 1} \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q. \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

Since (\ref{inverse extremality}) may blow up as $p \to \infty$, we have to renormalize the $q$-harmonic conjugates of $p$-tight forms before taking the limit $q \to 1$, as in \cite[\S3.2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Suppose that $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$, and let $k_p$ be defined by 
$$k_p^{1 - p} = \int_M \star |F_p|^p$$
where $F_p$ is the $p$-tight representative of $\rho$.

\begin{lemma}\label{normalizations converge}
As $p \to \infty$, $k_p \to \Comass(\rho)^{-1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We follow \cite[Lemma 3.4]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
By Lemma \ref{p tights approximate L},
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} k_p^{-\frac{1}{q}} = \lim_{p \to \infty} \|F_p\|_{L^p} = \Comass(\rho).$$
Taking logarithms we see that $q^{-1} \log k_p \to -\log \Comass(\rho)$, and since $q \to 1$ the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{renormalized $q$-harmonic conjugate} of a $p$-tight form $F_p$ is the function $u_q: \tilde M \to \RR$ which has mean zero on $M_{\rm fun}$ and solves
$$\dif u_q = (-1)^{d - 1} k_p^{p - 1} |F_p|^{p - 2} \star F_p.$$
\end{definition}

The utility of renormalized $q$-harmonic conjugates is that they remain bounded, and uniformly far from $0$, in $W^{1, q}(M_{\rm fun})$, as we now make precise.

We are now ready to construct a $1$-harmonic conjugate to a tight form.

\begin{proposition}\label{existence 1}
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ be a nonzero class.
For $d < p < \infty$ and $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$, let $u_q$ be the renormalized $q$-harmonic conjugate of the $p$-tight representative of $\rho$.
Then there exists a $1$-harmonic conjugate $u$ of $F$ such that as $q \to 1$ along a subsequence, $u_q \to u$ weakly in $BV_\loc(\tilde M)$ and strongly in $L^r_\loc(\tilde M)$ for $1 \leq r < \frac{d}{d - 1}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $L := \Comass(\rho)$.
We first compute using H\"older's inequality and Lemma \ref{normalizations converge}
\begin{align}
\lim_{q \to 1} \|\dif u_q\|_{L^1}
&\leq \lim_{q \to 1} |M|^{\frac{1}{p}} \left[\int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q\right]^{\frac{1}{q}} = \lim_{p \to \infty} \left[k_p^p \int_M \star |F_p|^p\right]^{\frac{1}{q}} \label{Rellich 1}\\
&= \lim_{p \to \infty} k_p^{\frac{1}{q}} = \lim_{p \to \infty} k_p = \frac{1}{L} \label{Rellich 2}.
\end{align}
So by Rellich's theorem, $(u_q)$ is weakly compact in $BV$ and strongly compact in $L^r$ for $1 \leq r < \frac{d}{d - 1}$.
In particular, $\dif u_q \to \dif u$ in the weak topology of measures and $u_q \to u$ weakly in $BV$ and strongly in $L^r$.
As the limit of $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant functions, $u$ is also $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant by Lemma \ref{L1 convergence preserves pi1}.
In particular, $\dif u$ drops to a current on $M$.
Moreover, $[\dif u_q] \to [\dif u]$, and we have the bound (\ref{q to 1 Holder}) on $\int \star |\dif u|$.

We next must check that $u$ is nonconstant.
If $u$ is constant, then it is $\pi_1(M)$-invariant, so $[\dif u_q] \to 0$.
By (\ref{q Laplacian Sobolev regularity estimate}), $\|\dif u_q\|_{L^q} \to 0$, so by (\ref{Rellich 1}, \ref{Rellich 2}), $L = \infty$, which is absurd.
Therefore $u$ is nonconstant.

Renormalizing (\ref{strong duality}), we obtain 
$$\frac{k_p^{-p}}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q + \frac{1}{p} \int_M \star |F_p|^p = k_p^{1 - p} \int_M \dif u_q \wedge F_p.$$
Multiplying by $k_p^p$, we have 
\begin{equation}\label{1 strong duality before limits}
	\frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q + \frac{k_p^p}{p} \int_M \star |F_p|^p = k_p \int_M \dif u_q \wedge F_p.
\end{equation}

Let $\mu(U) := \Mass_U(\dif u)$ be the total variation measure of $\dif u$.
We claim that
\begin{equation}\label{1 strong duality}
	L\mu(M) \leq \int_M \dif u \wedge F.
\end{equation}
First, we have from (\ref{q to 1 Holder}) and (\ref{1 strong duality before limits}) that
$$\mu(M) \leq \lim_{q \to 1} \frac{1}{q} \int_M \star |\dif u_q|^q = \lim_{p \to \infty} k_p \int_M \dif u_q \wedge F_p - \lim_{p \to \infty} \frac{k_p^p}{p} \int_M \star |F_p|^p.$$
By Lemma \ref{normalizations converge},
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \frac{k_p^p}{p} \int_M \star |F_p|^p = \lim_{p \to \infty} \frac{k_p}{p} = \frac{0}{L} = 0,$$
and
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} k_p \int_M \dif u_q \wedge F_p = \frac{1}{L} \lim_{p \to \infty} \int_M [\dif u_q] \wedge \rho.$$
Since $[\dif u_q] \to [\dif u]$, we obtain
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \int_M [\dif u_q] \wedge \rho = \int_M \alpha \wedge \rho = \int_M \dif u \wedge F,$$
completing the proof of (\ref{1 strong duality}).

By the coarea formula (\ref{coarea formula}), we have for any open set $U$,
$$\int_U \dif u \wedge F = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{U \cap \partial \{u > y\}} F \dif y \leq L \int_{-\infty}^\infty |U \cap \partial \{u > y\}| \dif y = L \mu(U).$$
Since $\mu$ is a Radon measure and $M$ is compact, every Borel set $E$ can be $\mu$-approximated from without by open sets, hence
\begin{equation}\label{one sided extremality}
\int_E \dif u \wedge F \leq L \mu(E).
\end{equation}

Next we deduce (\ref{1 extremality}).
We reason by contradiction: if (\ref{1 extremality}) is false, then there exists an open set $U \subseteq M$ such that 
$$\int_U \dif u \wedge F < L \int_U \star |\dif u|.$$
(Indeed, strict inequality cannot point in the other direction, by (\ref{one sided extremality}).)
However, by (\ref{one sided extremality}), 
$$\int_{M \setminus U} \dif u \wedge F \leq L \int_{M \setminus U} \star |\dif u|.$$
Adding up the integrals of $\dif u \wedge F$ over $U$ and $M \setminus U$, we conclude 
$$\int_M \dif u \wedge F < L \int_M \star |\dif u|,$$
but this contradicts (\ref{1 strong duality}); thus (\ref{1 extremality}) must be true.

To round out the proof, let $X := (\star F/L)^\sharp$ be the Poincar\'e dual vector field to $F/L$. Then
$$\nabla \cdot X = \star \frac{\dif F}{L} = 0,$$
and $\|X\|_{L^\infty} \leq 1$.
Moreover, by (\ref{1 extremality}), $X$ is normal to the level sets of $u$, and hence is a witness that $u$ is $1$-harmonic.
\end{proof}

\section{The maximum comass locus}\label{MCL sec}
Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian of dimension $2 \leq d \leq 4$ equipped with a cohomology class $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
We shall study the set on which a best comass representative of $\rho$ attains its comass.
This set turns out to contain a measured oriented minimal lamination which only depends on $\rho$, and which is calibrated by any best comass form on $\rho$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Measured stretch laminations}
Let $u$ be a $\pi_1(M)$-equivariant $1$-harmonic function on $\tilde M$, which is nonconstant, so that $\dif u$ has nonempty support.
Then $\dif u$ drops to a $d-1$-current on $M$, which is still the Ruelle-Sullivan current of a measured oriented minimal lamination on $M$, which we still call $\lambda_u$.
\todo{Cite the right theorems and formulate this for arbitrary $d$ when possible.}
Thus the following definition makes sense.

\begin{definition}
Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$, let $F$ be a tight representative of $\rho$, and let $u$ be a $1$-harmonic conjugate of $F$.
Then we call $\lambda_u$ a \dfn{measured stretch lamination} associated to $\rho$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{MCL contains Thurston}
Let $F$ be a best comass representative of $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$, where $\Comass(\rho) = 1$, and let $\lambda$ be a measured stretch lamination associated to $\rho$.
Then $F$ calibrates $\lambda$. In particular, $\MCL(F) \supseteq \supp \lambda$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be the tight form which is cohomologous to $F$ whose dual $1$-harmonic function $u$ defines the measured stretch lamination $\lambda$.
Then by the max flow min cut principle (\ref{1 extremality}), 
$$\Mass(\lambda) = \Mass(\dif u) = \int_M \dif u \wedge G$$
so $G$ calibrates $\lambda$ by Proposition \ref{calibration condition}.
Then by Proposition \ref{properties of calibrated laminations}, $F$ calibrates $\lambda$ and $\MCL(F) \supseteq \supp \lambda$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{L equals K}
	Let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ have measured stretch lamination $\mu$, and let $\lambda$ range over measured oriented laminations. Then 
	$$\Comass(\rho) = \sup_\lambda \frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle}{\Mass(\lambda)} = \frac{\langle \rho, [\mu]\rangle}{\Mass(\mu)}.$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Fix a tight form $F$ representing $\rho$, and let $u$ be its $1$-harmonic conjugate.
Let $L := \Comass(\rho)$ and
$$K :=  \sup_\lambda \frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle}{|\lambda|}.$$

We first prove $K \leq L$.
Let $\lambda$ be a measured oriented lamination; then, since $F$ represents $\rho$ and the Ruelle-Sullivan current $T_\lambda$ represents $[\lambda]$,
$$\langle \rho, [\lambda]\rangle = \int_M F \wedge T_\lambda.$$
Let $(\chi_\alpha)$ be a partition of unity subordinate to a laminar atlas for $\lambda$, and let $(\mu_\alpha)$ be the associated transverse measure. Then 
$$\int_M F \wedge T_\lambda = \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\{k\} \times J} \chi_\alpha F \dif \mu_\alpha(k).$$
Since $F$ has best comass,
$$\frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda] \rangle}{\Mass(\lambda)}
\leq \frac{\|F\|_{L^\infty}}{\Mass(\lambda)} \sum_\alpha \int_I \int_{\{k\} \times J} \chi_\alpha \dif S_k \dif \mu_\alpha(k) = L.$$
Since $\lambda$ was arbitrary, it holds that $K \leq L$.

By the max flow min cut principle (\ref{1 extremality}),
$$\langle \rho, [\mu]\rangle = \int_M F \wedge \dif u = L \Mass(\dif u) = L \Mass(\mu).$$
Dividing both sides by $\Mass(\mu)$ and applying the direction we already proved,
$$K \leq L \leq \frac{\langle \rho, [\mu]\rangle}{\Mass(\mu)} \leq K$$
which is only possible if $L = K$ and $\mu$ is a maximizer.
\end{proof}

Propositions \ref{MCL contains Thurston} and \ref{L equals K} imply Theorem \ref{lams are calibrated}.

As a corollary we obtain a special case of Federer's max flow min cut theorem, Theorem \ref{Federer}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{Federer} if $d \leq 4$]
It suffices to show that if we view $H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ and $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ as Banach spaces, equipped with the stable and costable norms respectively, then $H_{d - 1}$ and $H^{d - 1}$ are mutually dual.
Since $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ is finite-dimensional and therefore reflexive \cite[Theorem 1.13.5]{megginson1998introduction}, it suffices to show that the dual space to $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ is $H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
Since we may view the homologically area-minimizing representative of a homology class as a measured oriented minimal lamination, every homology class contains a measured oriented minimal lamination which is homologically area-minimizing.
Therefore, for any $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$, we obtain from Proposition \ref{L equals K} that
\begin{align*}
\Comass(\rho) &= \sup_\lambda \frac{\langle \rho, [\lambda] \rangle}{\Mass(\lambda)} = \sup_{\alpha \in H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)} \frac{\langle \rho, \alpha\rangle}{\Mass(\alpha)}. \qedhere 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The case of a tight calibration}
\todo{This is all very speculative}

\begin{proposition}
Let $F$ be a tight calibration and $N \subset M$ an oriented connected Lipschitz hypersurface such that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $N \cap \MCL(F)$ is nonempty.
	\item $\dif S_N = F/|F|$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $\dif S_N = F$, or in other words $N$ is $F$-calibrated.
In particular, $N \subseteq \MCL(F)$.
\end{proposition}

To start the proof we approximate $F$ by $p$-tight forms $F_p$, which satisfy 
$$0 = \dif(|F_p|^{p - 2} \star F_p).$$

\todo{Move this lemma to the section on local comass if everything here pans out}
We next show that local comass is lower semicontinuous on $L^p$ closed forms.
\todo{This is not true but maybe convergence is so strong that it's fine}

\begin{lemma}
Suppose that $F_n, F$ are closed $d - 1$-forms, $d < p < \infty$, and $F_n \to F$ in $L^p$.
Then for every $x \in M$,
$$\Comass(F, x) \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \Comass(F_n, x).$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $x \in M$ and $\varepsilon > 0$.
Then by definition of $\Comass(F, x)$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for every $0 < r < \delta$, there exists an integral $d - 1$-current $\sigma_r \subset B(x, r)$ such that 
$$\int_{\sigma_r} F \geq (\Comass(F, x) - \varepsilon) \Mass(\sigma_r).$$
However, by the trace theorem, $\int_{\sigma_r} F_n \to \int_{\sigma_r} F$, so there exists $N_r \in \NN$ such that for every $n \geq N$,
$$\int_{\sigma_r} F_n \geq (\Comass(F, x) - 2 \varepsilon) \Mass(\sigma_r).$$

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
For each $p$ sufficiently large on a subsequence, there exists an open set $U_p \supseteq \MCL(F)$ such that such that $F_p|_{U_p}$ is $C^{1 + \alpha}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

Therefore the product rule is justified and we have
$$0 = \dif(|F_p|^{p - 2}) \wedge \star F_p - |F_p|^{p - 2} \dif \star F_p.$$
In particular \todo{fill in the details} for every vector field $X$ (here we use $d = 3$ for the sake of argument)
$$(\dif (|F_p|^2), \iota_X F_p) = \pm \frac{2}{p - 2} |F_p|^2 \iota_X (\dif^* F_p).$$
Note that $\iota_X F$ is in the span of $X^\perp$ where the perp is taken in the tangent bundle of $N$.
Also along $N$ we can write $F = u \dif S_N$.
\todo{Taking limits in a suitable viscosity sense}
$$\nabla_N (u^2) = 0.$$
In particular $\nabla_N u = 0$, or in other words $u = 1$ identically on $N$.
This argument works on a neighborhood of $N \cap \MCL(F)$ but bootstrapping means it works everywhere.

\subsection{The canonical lamination}
Let $\rho$ be the homotopy class of a homeomorphism of two closed hyperbolic surfaces.
Thurston constructed a geodesic lamination, the \dfn{canonical lamination} of $\rho$, which can be dually viewed as the intersection of the maximum Lipschitz loci of all the best Lipschitz representatives of $\rho$, or the union of all measured geodesic laminations which are maximally stretched by $\rho$ in the sense of (\ref{L is K}) \cite[\S8]{Thurston98}.

We seek an analogous lamination in our setting.
Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $d \in \{2, 3\}$.
Let $\rho$ be a point on the unit sphere of $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$, thus $\Comass(\rho) = 1$.
If $F$ is a best comass representative of $\rho$, it need not be the case that $\MCL(F)$ is a lamination \cite[Example 5.4]{bangert_cui_2017}, so we shall not be able to show that the intersection of all maximum comass loci of best comass representatives of $\rho$ is a lamination.
But we shall show that the union of the measured stretch laminations is a lamination, contained in the intersection of the maximum comass loci.
\todo{No we won't, write this carefully. Also it's chain recurrent laminations, not measured laminations}

\begin{definition}
Let $\lambda, \mu$ be laminations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that $\lambda$ is a \dfn{sublamination} of $\mu$, and write $\lambda \preceq \mu$, if every leaf of $\lambda$ is a leaf of $\mu$.
\item If $\lambda, \mu$ have a common leaf, their \dfn{meet} $\lambda \wedge \mu$ is defined to be the lamination whose leaves are leaves of both $\lambda$ and of $\mu$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The meet of arbitrarily many laminations which all have a common leaf is well-defined, because if $(f, K)$ is a flow box for one such lamination $\lambda$, and $K'$ is the set of $k \in K$ such that $\{k\} \times J$ is contained in a common leaf, then $(f, K')$ is a flow box for the meet.

\begin{lemma}
There exists a constant $C > 0$, only depending on $M$, such that for every calibration $F$ and complete $F$-calibrated hypersurface $L$, we have the curvature bound
\begin{equation}\label{curvature bound for calibrated}
\|\Two_L\|_{C^0} \leq C.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $B \subset M$ be a sufficiently small ball and $N$ a component of $L \cap B$ (so $\partial N \subset \partial B$).
Since $B$ is contractible, we may write $F = \dif A$ in a neighborhood of $B$, where by Lemma \ref{Hodge theorem} and the Sobolev embedding theorem we may assume that $A$ is continuous.
Then if $N'$ is another complete connected hypersurface in $B$ with $\gamma := \partial N = \partial N'$,
$$\Mass(N) = \int_N F = \int_\gamma A = \int_{N'} F \leq \Mass(N'),$$
so $N$ is a stable minimal surface with respect to the Dirichlet problem for $B$.
By the stable Bernstein theorem \cite[Theorem 2.10]{colding2011course}, if $B' \Subset B$ is a smaller ball, then
$$\|\Two_N\|_{C^0(B')} \leq C_{B'}.$$
We may cover $M$ by balls of the form $B'$; by compactness we may in fact choose finitely many of them, and let $C$ be the maximal value of $C_{B'}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{calibrated implies disjoint}
Let $F$ be a calibration, and let $N, N'$ be complete connected $F$-calibrated hypersurfaces.
If $N \cap N'$ is nonempty, then $N = N'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We first observe that if $x \in N \cap N'$, then $(\star F(x))^\sharp$ is the normal vector to both $N, N'$ at $x$.
Thererfore $N \cap N'$ only consists of points of tangency.

If $d = 2$, then we can parametrize $N, N'$; the parametrizations solve the geodesic equation, and if we start the parametrization at any point of tangency, the parametrizations have the same initial data.
By the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, the parametrizations are equal, so the germs of $N, N'$ at each point of tangency are equal.
Since $N, N'$ are complete connected geodesics it follows that $N = N'$.

Otherwise, $d = 3$, and we shall assume towards contradiction that $N \neq N'$.
By \cite[Theorem 7.3]{colding2011course}, the set of points of tangency is discrete, and from each point of tangency $x$, there is a curve $\gamma \subset N \cap N'$ emanating from $x$ which contains no points of tangency.
This contradicts the fact that $N \cap N'$ has only points of tangency.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{existence of semicanonical lamination}
Let $F$ be a best comass calibration.
Then the set of $F$-calibrated hypersurfaces is the set of leaves of a lamination $\lambda_F$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\mathscr L_F$ be the set of connected complete $F$-calibrated hypersurfaces.
By Lemma \ref{calibrated implies disjoint}, $\mathscr L_F$ consists of pairwise disjoint minimal hypersurfaces.
By Proposition \ref{MCL contains Thurston}, there is an $F$-calibrated lamination $\lambda$, and then by Proposition \ref{properties of calibrated laminations}, there is an $F$-calibrated leaf of $\lambda$, which implies that $\mathscr L_F$ is nonempty.
Since the estimate (\ref{curvature bound for calibrated}) is independent of $L$, it follows by Theorem \ref{disjoint surfaces are lamination} that $\mathscr L_F$ is the set of leaves of some lamination $\lambda_F$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{existence of canonical lamination}
Let $\rho$ be a point on the unit sphere of $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
Then the set of hypersurfaces which are calibrated by every best comass representatives of $\rho$ is the set of leaves of a lamination $\lambda_\rho$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{MCL contains Thurston}, the best comass representatives of $\rho$ all calibrate a common leaf.
So we may take the meet of the laminations $\lambda_F$ defined by Lemma \ref{existence of semicanonical lamination}, where $F$ ranges over best comass representatives of $\rho$, to obtain a lamination $\lambda_\rho$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $\rho$ be a point on the unit sphere of $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
The lamination $\lambda_\rho$ constructed in Proposition \ref{existence of canonical lamination} is the \dfn{canonical lamination} associated to $\rho$.
\end{definition}

\todo{What is the structure of the canonical lamination?}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Global structure of calibrated laminations}
\todo{All this is pretty speculative and informally written.}

\begin{definition}
A lamination $\lambda$ is \dfn{transitive} if every leaf of $\lambda$ is dense in $\supp \lambda$.
\end{definition}

I called it this because minimal set is taken and it reminds me of topologically transitive.

\begin{lemma}
Let $\lambda$ be a lamination. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The closure of any leaf of $\lambda$ is the support of a sublamination of $\lambda$.
\item $\lambda$ is transitive iff $\lambda$ has no proper sublaminations.
\item $\lambda$ has a transitive sublamination.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We first recall that $\supp \lambda$ is closed, so if $N$ is a leaf of $\lambda$, then $\overline N \subseteq \supp \lambda$.
So let $N'$ be a leaf of $\lambda$ and $P \in (\overline N \setminus N) \cap N'$.
Choose coordinates $(x, y)$ based at $P$ where $N' = \{y = 0\}$.
Then in a neighborhood of $P$, we can write $N$ as consisting of sheets $\{y = f_n(x)\}$, and after reordering the sheets and reorienting the coordinate system, we may assume that $0 < f_{n + 1} < f_n$.
Thus $f_n(x)$ decreases to some $f(x)$ such that $f(0) = 0$.
In particular,
$$\{y = f(x)\} \subseteq \overline N \setminus N \subseteq \supp \lambda$$
so $\{y = f(x)\}$ must be a sheet of a leaf of $\lambda$; since $f(0) = 0$ and $(0, 0) \in N'$, it follows that $\{y = f(x)\}$ is a sheet of $N'$.
Therefore $\overline N \cap N'$ is an open subset of $N'$; since it is clearly a closed subset of $N'$ and $N'$ is connected, it follows that $N' = \overline N \cap N'$, or in other words $N' \subseteq \overline N$.
The set $\mathscr L$ of leaves of $\lambda$ which meet $\overline N$ is therefore equal to the set of leaves contained in $\overline N$, hence the union of $\mathscr L$ is closed.
So $\mathscr L$ is the set of leaves of a sublamination of $\lambda$, whose support is obviously $\overline N$.

If $\lambda$ is transitive and $\mu \preceq \lambda$, then the closure of any leaf of $\mu$ must contain $\supp \lambda$, so $\lambda \preceq \mu$, hence $\lambda = \mu$.
Conversely, if $\lambda$ is nontransitive, then there is a leaf $N$ of $\lambda$ such that $\overline N \subset \supp \lambda$, so that $\overline N$ is the support of a proper sublamination of $\lambda$.

Finally, let $\mathscr P$ be the poset of sublaminations of $\lambda$ with the ordering $\preceq$.
If $\mathscr C \subseteq \mathscr P$ is a chain, then the laminations in $\mathscr C$ have a common leaf, so the meet of $\mathscr C$ is well-defined and therefore is a lower bound of $\mathscr C$.
So by Zorn's lemma, $\mathscr P$ has a minimal element, which has no proper sublaminations and therefore is transitive.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let $\lambda$ be a lamination.
A \dfn{spiral} is a leaf of $\lambda$ which is not contained in any transitive sublamination of $\lambda$.
\end{definition}

By \cite[Theorem 3.2]{Morgan88}, a measured lamination contains no spirals.
We want a converse:

\begin{proposition}
Every lamination which contains no spirals admits a transverse measure.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Laminations of rational homological direction}
Maximum comass loci in general may be highly unstructured.
However, if the associated measured stretch lamination satisfies the below rationality condition, then their structure is greatly simplified.

\begin{definition}
A measured oriented lamination $\lambda$ has \dfn{rational homological direction} if there exists $c > 0$ such that $c [\lambda]$ is an integral class.
\end{definition}

The intuition behind why this condition should help is that if $u$ is a $1$-harmonic function on $\tilde M$ and $[\lambda_u]$ is an integral class, then $u$ drops to a $1$-harmonic map $M \to \Sph^1$.
In particular, the leaves of $\lambda_u$ should be parametrized by a compact set $S \subset \Sph^1$; one then expects the leaves to form a ``flat family'' over $S$.
This is illustrated by a simple example:

\begin{example}
Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic surface equipped with a homotopy class $\alpha$ of maps $M \to \Sph^1$ with winding number $1$.
Using (\ref{Poincare Hurcewiz}) and (\ref{Poincare Hurcewiz 2}) we obtain a homology class of curves in $M$, from which we choose the geodesic representative $\gamma$.
Then the $1$-harmonic map $u$ in the homotopy class $\alpha$ lifts to a map $\tilde u: M_{\rm fun} \to \RR$ which is $0$ on one side of the lifted geodesic $\tilde \gamma$, and $1$ on the other side of $\tilde \gamma$.
Identifying $0, 1$ with the north pole of $\Sph^1$, we see that $u$ maps almost all of $M$ to the north pole $\infty$ of $\Sph^1$, but still has winding number $1$ as it wraps arbitrarily small neighborhoods of $\gamma$ around $\Sph^1$.
Then $\lambda_{\tilde u}$ consists of a single leaf, parametrized by $\{\infty\}$.
\end{example}

To make the above intuition precise, we write $\lambda = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$ to mean that there are disjoint open subsets of $M$ containing the supports of laminations $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$, such that every leaf of $\lambda$ is a leaf of either $\lambda_1$ or $\lambda_2$.
In particular, if $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ are measured laminations, the Ruelle-Sullivan current of $\lambda$ is the sum of the Ruelle-Sullivan currents of $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$.

\begin{definition}
A \dfn{parallel family of closed leaves} is a lamination $\lambda$ with a closed leaf $N$, such that $N$ has trivial normal bundle $E$, and every leaf of $\lambda$ is a section of $E$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose that a measured oriented minimal lamination $\lambda$ has rational homological direction.
Then we can write
$$\lambda = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i$$
where $\lambda_i$ is a measured oriented parallel family of closed, homologically area-minimizing leaves.
\end{proposition}

\todo{It follows from Morgan--Shelan and Auer--Bangert. Only write up this proof if this is actually useful.}

\begin{lemma}
The set of cohomology classes which admit a measured stretch lamination of rational homological direction is dense in $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The image of $H_{d - 1}(M, \ZZ) \to H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ is a lattice, hence has a finite generating set $e_1, \dots, e_k$.
If $\alpha \in H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ and we write $\alpha = \sum_i \alpha_i e_i$, we can approximate $\alpha_i$ arbitrarily well by a rational number $p_i/q_i$.
Then we may set $q := \prod_i q_i$ and observe that $q \alpha$ is arbitrarily close to an integral class; hence classes of rational direction are dense in $H_{d - 1}(M, \RR)$. \todo{Now dualize this?}
\end{proof}

\todo{Is the set of homology classes with only homologically area-minimizing leaves GENERIC?}



\todo{Tie all this in with Thurston somehow}

% \begin{corollary}\label{existence of calibrations}
% Every closed area-minimizing hypersurface can be calibrated.
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{proof}
% Let $\alpha$ be the homology class of a closed area-minimizing hypersurface $N$.
% By duality between the stable norm and the best comass, and local compactness of $H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$, there is a cohomology class $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ such that $\Comass(\rho) = 1$ and, if $F$ is a best comass representative of $\rho$,
% $$|N| = \Mass(\alpha) = \langle \rho, \alpha\rangle = \int_N F.$$
% Therefore $F$ calibrates $N$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \section{Smooth calibrations of surfaces}
% The work of this paper is concerned with measurable calibrations; proofs would be significantly easier if we restricted to smooth, or even continuous, calibrations, as in past works \cite{bangert_cui_2017,Harvey82}.
% Thus it is natural to ask which manifolds admit a smooth best comass calibration in every cohomology class.
% Closed manifolds of dimension $d \geq 8$ need not admit smooth calibrations \cite{Zhang17}, so a proof of the existence of smooth calibrations must either use tangent cone analysis, or otherwose be dimension-specific.

% Here we consider the case of surfaces.
% In this case the problem of constructing a smooth calibration is simplified significantly by the fact that if $M$ is a surface with universal abelian cover $\tilde M$, $\rho \in H^1(M, \RR)$ satisfies $\Comass(\rho) = 1$ and is viewed as a representation of $\pi_1(M)$ as in (\ref{Poincare Hurcewiz}), and
% $$\tilde u: \tilde M \to \RR$$
% is a $C^{r + 1}$, $\rho$-equivariant function, which is best Lipschitz among $\rho$-equivariant functions, then $\dif \tilde u$ drops to a $C^r$ best comass calibration $\dif u$ on $M$.
% Thus, it suffices to prove the following:

% \begin{theorem}\label{existence of smooth calibrations}
% Let $M$ be a closed manifold with universal abelian cover $\tilde M$, and $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
% Then there exists a smooth, $\rho$-equivariant best Lipschitz function on $\tilde M$.
% \end{theorem}

% The key ingredient in the proof of Theorem \ref{existence of smooth calibrations} is the following proposition, which may be of independent interest, and asserts that it is possible to mollify a function while preserving its equivariance and Lipschitz constant.

% \begin{proposition}\label{existence of adapted mollifier}
% Let $M$ be a closed manifold with universal abelian cover $\tilde M$, and $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$.
% For every $\rho$-equivariant Lipschitz function $u$ on $\tilde M$ and every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a $\rho$-equivariant smooth function $u_\varepsilon$ such that
% \begin{align*}
% \|u - u_\varepsilon\|_{C^0} &< \varepsilon \\
% \Lip(u_\varepsilon) &\leq \Lip(u).
% \end{align*}
% \end{proposition}

% \begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{existence of smooth calibrations}, given Proposition \ref{existence of adapted mollifier}]
% By \cite[Theorem 2.4]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} (or rather its analogue for equivariant functions on $\tilde M$), there exists a $\rho$-equivariant best Lipschitz function $u$ on $\tilde M$. 
% If we choose $\varepsilon > 0$ and let $u_\varepsilon$ be as in Proposition \ref{existence of adapted mollifier}, then $u_\varepsilon$ is $\rho$-equivariant, smooth, and best Lipschitz.
% \end{proof}

% \subsection{Constructing the adapted mollifier}
% We now prove Proposition \ref{existence of adapted mollifier}.
% We fix a fundamental domain $M_{\rm fun} \subseteq \tilde M$, which is compact since $M$ is closed, and let $\Gamma$ be the abelianization of $\pi_1(M)$.

% Our first lemma may appear unusual at first glance.
% The problem of finding a $\rho$-equivariant harmonic function $u$ has a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, as the boundary condition and Dirichlet energy are preserved by translations $u \mapsto u + c$ where $c \in \RR$, the Lie algebra of $U(1)$.
% However, for our purposes, we must allow for a ``mass term'' $mu^2/2$ in the Lagrangian (\ref{Klein Gordon Lagrangian}) and break the gauge symmetry in order to ``hold back the effects of Ricci curvature'' in the sequel, even though the boundary condition still has such a symmetry.
% Ths is analogous to the Higgs mechanism, in which one deliberately breaks the $U(1) \times SU(2)$ gauge symmetry of the electroweak force to allow its Lagrangian to have mass terms.

% \begin{lemma}
% For every $m \geq 0$ there exists a function $w$ on $M_{\rm fun}$ which admits an extension as a $\rho$-equivariant function on $\tilde M$, and solves
% \begin{equation}\label{Klein Gordon}
% -\Delta w = -mw.
% \end{equation}
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% We introduce the Lagrangian 
% \begin{equation}\label{Klein Gordon Lagrangian}
% \Lagrange(v, \dif v) := \left[\frac{1}{2} |\dif v|^2 + \frac{m}{2} v^2\right] \dif V
% \end{equation}
% and the affine set $\mathscr A$ of functions in $W^{1, 2}(M_{\rm fun})$ which admit a $\rho$-equivariant extension.
% Then $\mathscr A$ is convex since it is affine, and 
% $$I(v) := \int_{M_{\rm fun}} \Lagrange(v, \dif v)$$
% is a coercive convex function on $\mathscr A$ since $m \geq 0$.
% Therefore $I$ has a minimizer $w$ \cite[Chapter II, Proposition 1.2]{Ekeland99}.
% Let $w_t := w + tv$ be a variation of $w$, thus $v$ admits a $\Gamma$-invariant extension, and
% \begin{align*}
% 0 &= \frac{\dif}{\dif t} \int_{M_{\rm fun}} \Lagrange(w_t, \dif w_t)\bigg|_{t = 0}
% = \int_{M_{\rm fun}} \left[\langle \dif w, \dif v\rangle + mwv\right] \dif V\\
% &= \int_{\partial M_{\rm fun}} v (\dif w, \normal_{\partial M_{\rm fun}}) \dif S + \int_{M_{\rm fun}} v(mw - \Delta w) \dif V.
% \end{align*}
% Since $w$ is $\rho$-equivariant and $v$ is $\Gamma$-invariant, $v \dif w$ is $\Gamma$-invariant.
% Therefore the integral over the region on which $v (\dif w, \normal_{\partial M_{\rm fun}})$ is positive cancels perfectly with the integral on the region on which it is negative and we are left with 
% $$\int_{M_{\rm fun}} v(mw - \Delta w) \dif V = 0.$$
% Since $v$ was an arbitrary $\Gamma$-invariant function, (\ref{Klein Gordon}) follows.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{lemma}
% Let $\lambda \geq 0$ be an eigenvalue of $-\Delta$ on $M$.
% Then for every $\rho$-equivariant function $\tilde u_0$ on $\tilde M$, there exists a $\rho$-equivariant function $\tilde u$ on $\tilde M \times \RR_+$ such that on $M_{\rm fun} \times \RR_+$,
% \begin{equation}\label{parabolic Klein Gordon}
% \begin{cases}
% (\partial_t - \Delta + \lambda) \tilde u = 0 \\
% \tilde u(0) = \tilde u_0.
% \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% We decompose
% $$\tilde u_0 = \tilde u_0^1 + \tilde u_0^2 + \tilde u_0^3$$
% where $\tilde u_0^1$ is $\Gamma$-invariant and $\tilde u_0^2 := w$ is the solution of (\ref{Klein Gordon}).
% In particular, $\tilde u_0^1$ drops to a function $u_0^1$ on $M$.
% The operator $\partial_t - \Delta + \lambda$ is parabolic, so there exists a solution\footnote{For a proof of existence for the initial-boundary value problem, see \cite[\S7.1, Theorem 3]{evans2010partial}; the proof on closed manifolds is even easier as there is no boundary condition.} of 
% $$\begin{cases}
% (\partial_t - \Delta - m) u^1 = 0 \\
% u^1(0) = u^1_0
% \end{cases}$$
% which then lifts to a $\Gamma$-invariant function $\tilde u^1$ on $\tilde M \times \RR_+$.
% After extending $\tilde u_0^2$ to a time-independent and $\rho$-equivariant function $\tilde u^2$ on $\tilde M \times \RR_+$, we can set 
% $$\tilde u := \tilde u^1 + \tilde u^2$$
% and observe that, since $\tilde u^1 + \tilde u^2$ solve (\ref{parabolic Klein Gordon}) on $M_{\rm fun}$, so does $\tilde u$.
% \end{proof}

% \begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{existence of adapted mollifier}]
% Choose an eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $-\Delta$ on $M$ so that the quadratic form $\Ric + \lambda g$ is positive-definite; this is possible because $M$ is closed, so that $\Ric$ is bounded from below and $M$ has arbitrarily large eigenvalues.
% Let $\tilde u_0 := u$, and let $\tilde u$ be a solution of (\ref{parabolic Klein Gordon}).
% Then by parabolic regularity, $\tilde u(t)$ is smooth on $M_{\rm fun}$ for any $t > 0$ and $\tilde u(t) \to \tilde u$ uniformly on $M_{\rm fun}$ as $t \to 0$ \cite[\S7.1, Theorem 7]{evans2010partial}.
% So we can define $u_\varepsilon := \tilde u(t)$ for some sufficiently small $t$.

% To estimate $\Lip(u_\varepsilon)$, let $v := |\nabla \tilde u|^2$.
% Then by Bochner's formula,
% \begin{align*}
% \frac{1}{2} \Delta v
% &= \langle \nabla \Delta \tilde u, \nabla \tilde u\rangle + |\nabla^2 \tilde u|^2 + \Ric(\nabla \tilde u, \nabla \tilde u) \\
% &\geq \langle \nabla (\partial_t + \lambda) \tilde u, \nabla \tilde u\rangle - \lambda v
% = \partial_t v.
% \end{align*}
% Therefore $v$ is a subsolution of the heat equation (with coefficient $1/2$), so by the parabolic maximum principle,
% $$\|v(t)\|_{L^\infty} = \Lip(\tilde u(t))^2$$
% is decreasing, as desired.
% \end{proof}

% \subsection{The dual Ryu-Takayanagi formula}
% In conformal field theory, one is often interested in the \emph{entanglement entropy} $S(N)$ through a closed oriented hypersurface $N \subset M$.
% This quantity has a physical definition, but according to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula \cite{Ryu_2006}, $S(N)$ is the area of any homologically area-minimizing hypersurface homologous to $N$.
% Owing to the conceptual difficulty of interpreting the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, Freedman and Headrick introduced a dual form of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, motivated by the max flow min cut principle \cite{Freedman_2016}.
% We would like to highlight the fact that the dual Ryu-Takayanagi formula actually follows immediately from Corollary \ref{existence of calibrations}.

% \begin{corollary}[dual Ryu-Takayanagi formula]
% For any closed oriented hypersurface $N \subset M$, the entanglement entropy through $N$ satisfies
% \begin{equation}\label{dual RT formula}
% S(N) = \max_{\substack{\dif F = 0 \\ L(F) \leq 1}} \int_N F.
% \end{equation}
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{proof}
% By Corollary \ref{existence of calibrations}, there exists a calibration $F$ of the area-minimizing hypersurface $N'$ homologous to $N$, and by Stokes' theorem, 
% $$S(N) = |N'| = \int_{N'} F = \int_N F.$$
% To see that $F$ is the maximum among all calibrations, let $G$ be another such form; then
% \begin{align*}
% \int_N G &= \int_{N'} G \leq |N'| = S(N). \qedhere

% \subsection{Existence of an optimal best comass form}
% \todo{exposit this}

% \begin{definition}
% An \dfn{optimal best comass form} is a best comass form $F$ such that
% $$\MCL(F) = \bigcap_G \MCL(G)$$
% where $G$ ranges over best comass forms cohomologous to $F$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{proposition}
% Let $\rho \in H^2(M, \RR)$.
% Then there exists an optimal best comass representative of $\rho$.
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
% Let $\lambda := \bigcap_G \MCL(G)$ where $G$ ranges over best comass representatives of $\rho$.
% For $x \notin \lambda$, we can find a best comass form $F_x$ of class $\rho$ such that $x \notin \MCL(F_x)$.
% In particular, $U_x := \{L(F_x, \cdot) < L\}$ is an open set which contains $x$, so $(U_x)_{x \notin \lambda}$ is an open cover of $M \setminus \lambda$.
% Since $M \setminus \lambda$ is $\sigma$-compact, there exists a countable subcover $(U_{x_i})_{i \in I}$, for some countable set $I \subseteq \NN$.

% We then introduce the closed form 
% $$F := \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i F_{x_i},$$
% where $\sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i = 1$.
% Here the sum converges in the norm topology of $L^\infty$, even if $I$ is infinite.
% Indeed, if $I_N := I \cap \{1, \dots, N\}$, then the partial sums $\sum_{i \in I_N} \alpha_i F_{x_i}$ satisfy the tail bound
% $$\sum_{i \in I \setminus I_N} \alpha_i \|F_{x_i}\|_{L^\infty} \leq L \sum_{i \in I \setminus I_N} \alpha_i \to 0$$
% since $(\alpha_i) \in \ell^1$, which implies the convergence.
% This convergence implies (by Proposition \ref{crandall}) that $[F] = \rho$, so $L(F) \geq L$.
% On the other hand, 
% $$L(F) \leq \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i L(F_{x_i}) \leq L \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i = L.$$
% It follows that $L(F) = L$.
% In particular, $F$ has best comass and $\MCL(F) \supseteq \lambda$.

% To complete the proof, we show that $\MCL(F) \subseteq \lambda$.
% Let $x \notin \lambda$, and let $j$ satisfy $U_{x_j} \ni x$.
% Then by Proposition \ref{crandall},
% $$L(F, x) = \lim_{r \to 0} L_{B_r(x)}(F) \leq \lim_{r \to 0} \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i L_{B_r(x)}(F_{x_i}).$$
% The summands are dominated by the $\ell^1$ sequence $(L\alpha_i)$, so by dominated convergence, 
% $$\lim_{r \to 0} \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i L_{B_r(x)}(F_{x_i}) = \sum_{i \in I} \lim_{r \to 0} \alpha_i L_{B_r(x)}(F_{x_i}) = \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i L(F_{x_i}, x).$$
% By assumption on $j$, $L(F_{x_j}, x) < L$, and besides $L(F_{x_i}, x) \leq L$ for any $i$.
% So 
% $$L(F, x) \leq \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i L(F_{x_i}, x) < L$$
% and we conclude $x \notin \MCL(F)$.

% \section{The \texorpdfstring{$\infty$-Maxwell equation}{infinity-Maxwell equation}}\label{EulerLagrange}
% We have the following Euler-Lagrange equation for forms with absolutely best comass.
% Because of the lack of a good analogue for viscosity solutions for $\infty$-elliptic systems, and because we did not show that $\infty$-tight forms have absolutely best comass, the equation can only really be interpreted in a formal sense, at least as far as we are aware.
% As such, we did not use it in the main body of this paper, but only include it as a curiosity item.

% % \todo{If we knew that $p$-Maxwell had good quantitative uniqueness, then we would have}
% % It remains to show that $A$ has absolutely best curl, so let $\Omega$ be a small ball and $B$ a $1$-form with $B|_{\partial \Omega} = A|_{\partial \Omega}$.
% % By a straightforward modification of the existence theorem, there exists a $p$-magnetic potential $B_p$ in Coulomb gauge with $B_p|_{\partial \Omega} = A|_{\partial \Omega}$ and $B \in C^{1 + \alpha}$.
% % By quantitative uniqueness
% % $$\|B_p - A\|_{C^0(\Omega)} \leq \|B_p - A_p\|_{C^0(\Omega)} + o(1) \lesssim \|A - A_p\|_{C^0(\partial \Omega)} + o(1) \ll 1.$$
% % Therefore $B_p \to A$ uniformly, and for $3 < q < p < \infty$ with $p$ dyadic,
% % $$\|\dif B_p\|_{L^q(\Omega)} \leq |\Omega|^{\frac{1}{q} -\frac{1}{p}} \|\dif B_p\|_{L^p(\Omega)} \leq |\Omega|^{\frac{1}{q} -\frac{1}{p}} \|\dif B\|_{L^p(\Omega)} \leq |\Omega|^{\frac{1}{q}} \|\dif B\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}.$$
% % Then along a subsequence, $\dif B_p \to \dif A$ in $L^q(\Omega)$, so 
% % $$\|\dif A\|_{L^q(\Omega)} \leq |\Omega|^{\frac{1}{q}} \|\dif B\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}.$$
% % Taking $q \to \infty$ we arrive at the conclusion that $F$ has absolutely best comass.



% The $\infty$-Maxwell equation has the following natural interpretation.

% \begin{corollary}
% Suppose that $F$ has absolutely best comass, regularity $C^1$, and no points with $F = 0$, and $N$ is a surface whose normal vector field is annihilated by $F$.
% Then $N$ is a minimal surface.
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{proof}
% Let $V$ be a tangent vector field to $N$. Then $V(|F|) = 0$, by (\ref{infinityMaxwell}).
% Therefore $|F|$ is constant along $N$, but $F$ is a continuous section of the area bundle of $N$, which is a real line bundle.
% It follows that $F$ is constant along $N$, and $F/|F|$ is the area form on $N$.
% In other words, $N$ is calibrated by $F$, and the claim follows from (\ref{calibrated surfaces are minimal}).
% \end{proof}






\section{Open problems}
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$p$-elliptic systems}{p-elliptic systems}}
The theory of $L^\infty$ variational problems is still nascent, especially in the case that the Euler-Lagrange equation is a \emph{system} of PDE.
Indeed, the theory of the $\infty$-Laplacian is largely built around the maximum principle and viscosity solutions, neither of which are available for systems of PDE (but see the recent work of Katzourakis \cite{Katzourakis2018OnAV}).
In the case $d \geq 3$, this is the situation dealt with in this paper; we have carefully sidestepped the lack of a theory of $L^\infty$ variational systems by working with $L^p$ variational systems, $d < p < \infty$, which can be written in divergence form, and then taking a limit.
When we do have to work in the limit, we passed to the dual problem, which was a \emph{scalar} $L^1$ variational problem.
However, by analogy with the scalar case, one expects the following characterization of tight forms to hold:

\begin{conjecture}
The following are equivalent for a closed $d - 1$-form $F$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ is tight.
\item $F$ has \dfn{absolutely best comass} in the sense that for every small ball $B \subseteq M$ and every closed $d - 1$-form $G$ whose pullback to $\partial B$ equals that of $F$, $\Comass_B(F) \leq \Comass_B(G)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{conjecture}

The difficulty of this conjecture arises from the lack of notion of ``tight'' that does not involve $p$-approximations, which could be avoided if one had a notion of weak solution for the system of PDE 
\begin{equation}\label{infinity Maxwell}
\begin{cases}
\dif F = 0\\
\nabla_i F_J F^J {F^i}_K = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
which is satisfied \emph{formally} by tight forms.
Here, $J$ is a $d - 1$-index and $K$ is a $d - 2$-index.

\begin{problem}
Introduce a notion of weak solution for (\ref{infinity Maxwell}) which generalizes the notion of viscosity solution for the $\infty$-Laplacian.
Show that a $d - 1$-form $F$ is a weak solution of (\ref{infinity Maxwell}) iff $F$ is tight.
\end{problem}

Another problem caused by the lack of the maximum principle is the apparent failure of tight forms to be unique.
This was already a problem in the work of Daskalopolous and Uhlenbeck on maps to $\Sph^1$ which inspired this work \cite[Conjecture 9.2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.

\begin{conjecture}
The tight $d - 1$-form in a cohomology class is unique.
\end{conjecture}

We should also point out that if $F_p$ is $p$-tight and we write $F_p = \dif A_p$, where the gauge potential $A_p$ satisfies $\dif^* A_p = 0$, then $A_p$ solves the $L^p$ analogue 
$$\dif^*(|\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p) + \dif(|\dif^* A_p|^{p - 2} \dif^* A_p) = 0$$
of the Laplace-de Rham equation. 
There is a rough principle that those estimates on the Laplace equation which do not depend on the maximum principle (or the closely related comparison principle and Harnack inequality) should also hold for the Laplace-de Rham equation.
Therefore one expects that those estimates on the $p$-Laplacian which do not depend on the maximum principle should hold for the $p$-Maxwell equation.
We did not pursue this line of inquiry here, since it is highly unlikely that such estimates would remain valid in the limit $p \to \infty$, but we believe that they should be true, hence:

\begin{problem}
Formulate and prove estimates on the $p$-Maxwell equation analogous to those estimates on the $p$-Laplacian proved in, for example, \cite[Chapter 11]{kinnunen2021maximal}, which do not rely on the maximum principle.
\end{problem}

\subsection{Nonclosed manifolds}
For simplicity in this paper we have only dealt with closed manifolds.
However, it is likely that the results largely go through for compact manifolds with boundary, as our arguments are mainly local, and for those that are not one can pass to the double of the manifold with boundary, as long as the boundary is not itself a minimal hypersurface.
There are genuine differences in the case of manifolds with infinite ends, since if $M$ is a manifold with cusps, the stable (semi)norm of every homology class in $M$ may be zero.
Still, one expects to be able to recover most of the results of this paper.

\begin{problem}
Formulate the results in this paper for complete Riemannian manifolds with boundary and infinite ends.
\end{problem}



% By analogy with $\infty$-harmonic functions, one expects tight forms to be unique and have \dfn{absolutely best comass} in the sense that they have best comass (subject to the Dirichlet condition) in every small open ball in $M$.
% One can show formally that the Euler-Lagrange equations for a smooth form $F$ of absolutely best comass are
% \begin{equation}\label{infinity Maxwell}
% \begin{cases}
% \dif F = 0\\
% \nabla_i F_J F^J {F^i}_K = 0
% \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% where $J$ is a $d - 1$-index and $K$ is a $d - 2$-index.
% Let us formally derive the $\infty$-Maxwell equation (\ref{infinity Maxwell}):

% \begin{lemma}
% When written in nondivergence form, the $p$-Maxwell equation is 
% \begin{equation}\label{p Maxwell nondivergence form}
% \begin{cases}
% \dif F = 0\\ 
% |F|^{p - 4} ((p - 2) \nabla_i F_J {F^i}_K F^J - |F|^2 (\dif^* F)_K) = 0.
% \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% Using the metric property of $\nabla$ and the fact that $d(d - 2) + 1 \equiv d - 1$ modulo $2$,
% \begin{align*}
% 0 &= \dif^*(|F|^{p - 2} F) \\
% &= (-1)^{d(d - 2) + 1} \star \dif(|F|^{p - 2} \star F) \\
% &= (-1)^{d - 1} \star(\dif(|F|^{p - 2}) \wedge \star F - |F|^{p - 2} \dif \star F) \\
% &= (-1)^{d - 1} (p - 2) \star(|F|^{p - 4} \langle \nabla F, F\rangle \wedge \star F) - |F|^{p - 2} \dif^* F.
% \end{align*}
% We then compute 
% $$(-1)^{d - 1} \star(\langle \nabla F, F\rangle \wedge \star F)_\ell = \nabla_i F_J F^J {F^i}_K$$
% and factor out $|F|^{p - 4}$ to conclude (\ref{p Maxwell nondivergence form}).
% \end{proof}

% Now, to derive the $\infty$-Maxwell equation, one may proceed as in the derivation of the $\infty$-Laplace equation in \cite{Barron08}.
% After formally dividing both sides of (\ref{p Maxwell nondivergence form}) by $(p - 2) |F|^{p - 4}$, one obtains the $\infty$-Maxwell equation, plus a term which vanishes as $p \to \infty$.

% Recently Katzourakis has introduced a generalization notion of viscosity solutions, called \dfn{contact solutions}, for systems of degenerate PDE which cannot necessarily be written in divergence form or diagonal form \cite{Katzourakis2018OnAV}.
% As the correct notion of solution for the $\infty$-Laplace equation is viscosity solution, it is natural to expect that the natural notion of solution of (\ref{infinity Maxwell}) is contact solution.
% Thus it is natural to conjecture:

% \begin{conjecture}
% For every $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \RR)$ there exists a unique tight representative of $\rho$.
% Moreover, the following are equivalent for a closed $d-1$-form $F$:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item $F$ has absolutely best comass.
% \item $F$ is tight.
% \item $F$ is a contact solution of the $\infty$-Maxwell equation (\ref{infinity Maxwell}).
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{conjecture}

% The theory of contact solutions is still nascent, and the \emph{uniqueness} theory of contact solutions appears to be out of reach at the time of writing.
% So we shall not attempt to prove this conjecture here.
% \todo{Prove part of this conjecture, at least that the $p$-tight forms are contact solutions.}

% \subsection{Integral hypersurfaces of classical tight forms}
% We have the following analogue of \cite[Lemma 1]{Aronsson68}.

% \begin{proposition}
% Let $F$ be a classical tight form with no zeroes, and let $N$ be an integral hypersurface of $F$.
% Then $N$ is a minimal hypersurface.
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
% Since $F/|F|$ is the area form on $N$, it suffices to show that $|F|$ is constant along $N$; if so, then $\dif(F/|F|) = |F|^{-1} \dif F = 0$.
% However, 
% \end{proof}

% %%%%%%%
% \subsection{Eikonal calibrations}
% Recall that that the \dfn{eikonal equation} on scalar fields $u$ is the PDE 
% $$|\dif u| = 1.$$
% If $u$ solves the eikonal equation, then $u$ also is $\infty$-harmonic \cite[\S]{Aronsson68}; this motivates us to study forms that satisfy the analogous condition.

% \begin{definition}
% An \dfn{eikonal calibration} is a $d-1$-form $F$ solving 
% \begin{equation}\label{eikonal}
% \begin{cases}
% \dif F = 0 \\
% |F| = 1.
% \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% \end{definition}

% An eikonal calibration is classically tight, since 
% $$0 = \partial_i (|F|^2) = \langle \nabla F, F\rangle_i = \nabla_i F_J F^J.$$
