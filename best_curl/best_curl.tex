\section{Introduction}
In this paper we study the following related minimization problems for a $1$-form $A$ in a Riemannian $3$-fold $M$ subject to a homological or boundary constraint:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Minimize the \dfn{$\infty$-Maxwell energy} $\|\dif A\|_{L^\infty}$.
\item Minimize the \dfn{curl modulus}
$$L(A) := \sup_{\sigma \in \Chain_2(M)} \frac{1}{|\sigma|} \left|\int_{\partial \sigma} A\right|$$
where $\Chain_2(M)$ denotes the space of oriented $2$-chains in $M$.
\end{enumerate}
Note: It might be more natural to replace the second with $\int_\sigma F$. Stokes' theorem guarantees that this works for plaquettes even if $F$ is bad.

The first problem corresponds to the $\infty$-Laplace equation, while the second corresponds to best Lipschitz functions.
For a discussion of our interest in this problem, see \S\ref{motivation}; for a more precise statement of our results without fluff, see \S\ref{results}.

\subsection{Notation}
\subsection{The de Rham--Sobolev complex}
\begin{definition}
For $1 < p < \infty$ and $0 \leq \ell \leq d$, let $W^{1, p}\Omega^\ell$ denote the space of $\ell$-forms $\alpha$ for which the norm
$$\|\alpha\|_{W^{1, p} \Omega^\ell}^p := \|\alpha\|_{L^p}^p + \|\dif \alpha\|_{L^p}^p$$
is finite.
The \dfn{de Rham--Sobolev complex} $W^{1, p} \Omega^\bullet$ is the chain complex of such spaces, with boundary maps 
$$\dif: W^{1, p} \Omega^\ell \to W^{1, p} \Omega^{\ell + 1}.$$
\end{definition}

The de Rham--Sobolev complex is a well-defined elliptic complex, since 
$$\|\dif \alpha\|_{W^{1, p} \Omega^{\ell + 1}}^p = \|\dif \alpha\|_{L^p}^p + \|\dif^2 \alpha\|_{L^p}^p = \|\dif \alpha\|_{L^p}^p \leq \|\alpha\|_{W^{1, p} \Omega^p}^p.$$
For $p = 2$, $d = 3$ this complex is well-known for its applications in electromagnetism and numerical analysis, and its constituent spaces are more commonly known as \cite[Chapter 2]{cessenat1996mathematical}
\begin{align*}
H(\text{curl}) &:= W^{1, 2} \Omega^1 \\
H(\text{div}) &:= W^{1, 2} \Omega^2.
\end{align*}

The utility of the de Rham--Sobolev complex is its trace theorem:

\begin{proposition}[trace theorem]
Let $N$ be an $\ell$-fold, and let $\iota: N \to M$ be a smooth immersion.
Then the pullback is a bounded linear operator 
$$\iota^* W^{1, p} \Omega^\ell(M) \to W^{-\frac{1}{p}, p}(N, \Omega^\ell).$$
In particular, for every $\alpha \in W^{1, p} \Omega^\ell(M)$ and every $\beta \in W^{1, q}(M, \Omega^{d - \ell - 1})$, where $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$,
$$\int_N \iota^* \alpha \wedge \iota^* \beta = \int_M \dif \alpha \wedge \beta + \alpha \wedge \dif \beta.$$
\end{proposition}

\section{p-Maxwell}
\subsection{p finite}
Let $M$ be a Riemannian threefold, and fix a cohomology class $\xi \in H^2(M, \ZZ)$.
Equivalently, we could fix a $U(1)$ line bundle $\mathscr F \to M$ and consider its Chern class $\xi = c_1(\mathscr F)$.

\begin{definition}
Let $A_p$ be a connection on $\mathscr F$ and $1 < p < \infty$.
We call $A_p$ a \dfn{$p$-magnetic potential} if it is a minimizer of the \dfn{$p$-Maxwell energy} $\|\dif A_p\|_{L^p}$, $p \geq 2$. among all connections on $\mathscr F$.
\end{definition}

Instead of connections we could look at $1$-forms on the universal cover such that $\gamma^* A - A$ is closed for every deck transformation $\gamma$.
But we'll come back to that later.

\begin{lemma}[$p$-Maxwell equation]
Every $p$-magnetic potential $A_p$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{pMaxwell}
	\dif^*(|\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p) = 0
\end{equation}
in the weak sense that for every $1$-form $B$,
$$\int_M |\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p \wedge \dif B = 0.$$
Moreover, the second variation of the $p$-Maxwell energy at $A_p$, in the direction $B$, is
\begin{equation}\label{pSecondVariation}
p \int_M (p - 2) |\dif A_p|^{p - 4} \star \langle \dif A_p, \dif B\rangle^2 + \star |\dif A_p|^{p - 2} |\dif B|^2.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $A_p(t) := A_p + tB$; then 
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\dif}{\dif t} \int_M \star |\dif A_p(t)|^p
	&= p \int_M \star |\dif A_p(t)|^{p - 2} \dif A_p(t) \wedge \dif B.
\end{align*}
Setting $t = 0$, (\ref{pMaxwell}) follows.
We now differentiate again in $t$, and exploit the fact that
$$\star \langle \dif A_p, \dif B\rangle = \dif A_p \wedge \dif B,$$
to deduce (\ref{pSecondVariation}).
\end{proof}

If $p = 2$, then (\ref{pMaxwell}) reduces to the Maxwell equation (or equivalently the Yang-Mills equation with a $U(1)$ gauge group), which motivates the ``electromagnetic'' terminology that we use.
It would be interesting to consider the analogous equation for more general gauge groups, but we shall not do so here.
Since the gauge group in question is $U(1)$, we simply mean by a \dfn{gauge transformation} the addition of a closed $1$-form.
We as usual say that $A_p$ is in \dfn{Coulomb gauge} if $\dif^* A_p = 0$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $A_p$ be $p$-magnetic potentials on a $U(1)$ line bundle $\mathscr F$, and let $B$ range over all connections on $\mathscr F$.
Then 
\begin{equation}\label{infinity magnetic rules p magnetic}
	\|\dif A_p\|_{L^p} \leq |M|^{1/p} \inf_B \|\dif B\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By H\"older's inequality and the fact that $A_p$ is $p$-magnetic, for any $B$,
$$\|\dif A_p\|_{L^p} \leq \|\dif B\|_{L^p} \leq |M|^{1/p} \|\dif B\|_{L^\infty},$$
hence the same holds for the infimum.
\end{proof}

We put any norm on $H^2(M, \RR)$ (as all are equivalent), hence $|\xi|$ makes sense for $\xi \in H^2(M, \RR)$.

\begin{proposition}
Assume $p = 2^n$ for some integer $n \geq 2$, and let $\mathscr F$ be a $U(1)$ line bundle.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a $p$-magnetic potential $A_p$ which is a connection on $\mathscr F$.
\item $A_p$ is in Coulomb gauge, and every $p$-magnetic potential on $\mathscr F$ is a gauge transformation of $A_p$.
\item One has (for $A_p$ in Coulomb gauge)
\begin{equation}\label{Sobolev bounds for p}
	\|A_p\|_{W^{1, p}} \lesssim |c_1(\mathscr F)|.
\end{equation}
The constant is independent of $p$.
\item There exists $\alpha > 0$ such that $A_p \in C^{1 + \alpha}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $A_p(\varepsilon)$ be a smooth connection satisfying
$$\|\dif A_p(\varepsilon)\|_{L^p} \leq \inf_B \|\dif B\|_{L^p} + \varepsilon$$
where $B$ ranges over all connections on $L$. 
We may assume that $A_p(\varepsilon)$ is in Coulomb gauge, for there exists a function $f$ such that $\Delta f = \dif^* A_p(\varepsilon)$, and then we may replace $A_p(\varepsilon)$ with $A_p(\varepsilon) - \dif f$.

By \cite[\S8.2.2]{evans2010partial} and the fact that $p = 2^n$ implies that $x \mapsto |x|^p$ is smooth, the $p$-Maxwell energy is a $W^{1, p}$-weakly lower semicontinuous function.
Therefore, by a compactness argument, we have $A_p(\varepsilon) \to A_p$ along a subsequence in the weakstar topology on $W^{1, p}$, for some $W^{1, p}$ connection $A_p$ which minimizes the $p$-Maxwell energy.
By the Sobolev embedding theorem, $A_p(\varepsilon) \to A_p$ uniformly, so $A_p$ is in Coulomb gauge.

By weak convergence
$$\|A_p\|_{W^{1, p}} \leq \limsup_{\varepsilon \to 0} \|A_p(\varepsilon)\|_{W^{1, p}}$$
and by Poincar\'e's inequality and the facts that $A_p(\varepsilon)$ is in Coulomb gauge and $A_p$ is $p$-magnetic,
$$\|A_p(\varepsilon)\|_{W^{1, p}} \lesssim \|\dif A_p(\varepsilon)\|_{L^p} \leq \|\dif A_p\|_{L^p} + \varepsilon.$$
To bound this, we select a basis $c_1(\mathscr F_1), \dots, c_1(\mathscr F_r)$ for (the torsion-free part of) $H^2(M, \ZZ)$, and apply the above argument to obtain $q$-magnetic potentials $B_i$ on $\mathscr F_i$ for any dyadic $q \in [p, \infty)$.
For $q$ large enough, $\|\dif B_i\|_{L^q}$ is bounded independently of $q$ by (\ref{infinity magnetic rules p magnetic}).
Fix such a $q$, and then consider
$$c_1(\mathscr F) = \sum_{i=1}^r a_i c_1(\mathscr F_i).$$
Using the fact that $A_p$ is $p$-magnetic,
\begin{align*}
\|\dif A_p\|_{L^p}
&\leq \left\|\sum_{i=1}^r a_i B_i\right\|_{L^p} \leq \sum_i |a_i| \|\dif B_i\|_{L^p} \leq \sum_i |a_i| \|\dif B_i\|_{L^q} \lesssim \sum_i |a_i| \\
&\lesssim c_1(\mathscr F).
\end{align*}

We now prove uniqueness.
Assume that $A_p + B$ is another $p$-magnetic potential, so that $B$ is a $1$-form.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the second variation (\ref{pSecondVariation}) is bounded from below by 
$$p (p - 1) \int_M \star |\dif A_p|^2 |\dif B|^2.$$
But up to a gauge transformation of $A_p$, we may assume that $B$ is orthogonal to all closed $1$-forms, so that the second variation becomes strictly positive, as desired.

Finally, we deduce the $C^{1 + \alpha}$ elliptic regularity from \cite{Uhlenbeck77}.
\end{proof}

We do NOT get $C^\infty$ regular on sets $\Subset \{|\dif A_p| = 0\}$.
Why?
Expanding out the $p$-Maxwell equation for $A = A_p$,
$$0 = \partial^j(|\dif A|^{p - 2} \partial_j A_i) - |\dif A|^{p - 2} \partial_i (\dif^* A) - |\dif A|^{p - 2} [\partial^j, \partial_i] A_j - \partial^j(|\dif A|^{p - 2}) \partial_i A_j.$$
The first term is an elliptic operator with H\"older coefficients, the second can be gauged away, and the third is H\"older since $[\partial^j, \partial_i]$ is a connection coefficient of the metric.
But the last term is bad.
Maybe we can get rid of it using paraproducts?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{p infinity}
What follows is the main definition of this paper.

\begin{definition}
	Let $A$ be a connection on $\mathscr F$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that $A$ has \dfn{best curl} if $A$ is a minimizer of its curl modulus.
\item We say that $A$ has \dfn{absolutely best curl} if, in addition, $A$ has best curl for the Dirichlet problem in each small ball with respect to its own boundary condition. \todo{Make this more precise}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We will be interested in the points at which $A$ attains its curl modulus, which can be tested using a localized version of the curl modulus:

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{local curl modulus} of a $1$-form $A$ at $x \in M$ is 
$$L(A, x) := \limsup_{\varepsilon \to 0} \sup_{\sigma \in \Chain_2(B_\varepsilon(x))} \frac{1}{|\sigma|} \int_{\partial \sigma} A.$$
\end{definition}

Write $L_\Omega(A)$ for the curl modulus of the restriction of $A$ to a subdomain $\Omega$.
Then
$$L(A, x) = \limsup_{\varepsilon \to 0} L_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(A)$$
but $L_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(A)$ is increasing in $\varepsilon$ (since it's a supremum over a set which grows in $\varepsilon$).
So the limit superior is actually a limit and an infimum:
$$L(A, x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} L_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(A) = \inf_{\varepsilon > 0} L_{B_\varepsilon(x)}(A)$$
and in particular $L(A, x) \leq L(A)$.

It's convenient to test the local curl modulus against a more restrictive class of $2$-chains.
Motivated by lattice gauge theory \cite{Gupta98}, we define:

\begin{definition}
Fix an orthonormal frame $(\partial_i)$ on the tangent bundle $TM$.
A \dfn{plaquette} $R_{ij}^\varepsilon(x)$ is the exponential pushforward of a square $[0, \varepsilon \partial_i] \times [0, \varepsilon \partial_j]$ in the tangent space $T_x M$ to $M$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
For $(x, v) \in TM$ let $x + v := \exp_x(v)$, then
\begin{align*}
	L(A, x) 
	&= \sqrt{\limsup_{\varepsilon \to 0} \sum_{i < j} \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \left|\int_{\partial R_{ij}^\varepsilon(x)} A\right|^2}\\
	&= \sqrt{\limsup_{\varepsilon \to 0} \sum_{i < j} \frac{|A_i(x) + A_j(x + \varepsilon \partial_i) - A_i(x + \varepsilon \partial_j) - A_j(x)|^2}{\varepsilon^2}}.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Idea]
The plaquette has volume form $1 + O(\varepsilon^2)$ in normal coordinates so we might as well assume that it has surface area $\varepsilon^2$.
Continuity of $A$, and numerical approximation of Riemann integrals on continuous functions, gives the rest of the proof, where we mimic the proof that lattice gauge theories approximate the QCD action.
\end{proof}

At the time of writing the statement (but not the proof) of this lemma is the only place where we use $d = 3$.
In general you could take a signed sum over the vertices of a $d-1$-dimensional plaquette.

Following Crandall's paper we want to prove:

\begin{proposition}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $L(A, \cdot)$ is upper semicontinuous.
\item If $\dif A(x)$ exists then $L(A, x) \geq |\dif A(x)|$.
\item If $L(A, x) = 0$, then $\dif A(x)$ exists and $\dif A(x) = 0$.
\item If $\sigma \in \Chain_2$ then 
$$\frac{1}{|\sigma|} \left|\int_{\partial \sigma} A\right| \leq \sup_{x \in \sigma} L(A, x).$$
In particular, $L(A) \leq \sup_{x \in M} L(A, x)$.
\item $\dif A \in L^\infty$ as distributions iff $\sup_{x \in A} L(A, x) < \infty$, in which case 
$$\sup_{x \in M} L(A, x) = \|\dif A\|_{L^\infty}, \qquad L(A, x) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \|\dif A\|_{L^\infty(B_\varepsilon(x))}.$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
a is like in Crandall. Looking at plaquettes,
\begin{align*}
\dif A_{ij}(x) 
&= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \frac{A_i(x) + A_j(x + \varepsilon \partial_i) - A_i(x + \varepsilon \partial_j) - A_j(x)}{\varepsilon} \\
&= \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \varepsilon^{-2} \int_{\partial R_{ij}^\varepsilon} A
\end{align*}
which is clearly bounded by $L(A, x)$ proving b and c.
For d, since $A$ is continuous, we may assume up to an $o(\varepsilon)$ error that $\sigma$ is a sum of plaquettes 
$$\sigma = \sum_{n = 1}^{N_\varepsilon} R_{i_n j_n}^\varepsilon(x_n)$$
and then 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{|\sigma|} \int_\sigma A
&= \sum_{n = 1}^{N_\varepsilon} \frac{|R_{i_n j_n}^\varepsilon(x_n)|}{|R|} \frac{1}{|R_{i_n j_n}^\varepsilon(x_n)|} \int_{\partial R_{i_n j_n}^\varepsilon(x_n)} A \\
&\leq \sum_{n = 1}^{N_\varepsilon} \frac{|R_{i_n j_n}^\varepsilon(x_n)|}{|R|} L(A, x_n) \\
&\leq \sum_{n = 1}^{N_\varepsilon} \frac{|R_{i_n j_n}^\varepsilon(x_n)|}{|R|} \sup_{x \in \sigma} L(A|_{B_\varepsilon(x)}) \\
&\leq \sup_{x \in \sigma} L(A, x).
\end{align*}
Finally for e, let $\varphi$ be a $C^\infty_\cpt$ approximation to the $2$-current $[R]/|R|$ for a plaquette $R = R_{ij}^\varepsilon(x)$. Then 
$$\int_M \dif A \wedge \varphi = - \int_M A \wedge \dif \varphi = o(1) - \frac{1}{|R|} \int_{\partial R} A.$$
Also $\|\varphi\|_{L^1} = 1 + o(1)$ so by duality 
$$\|\dif A\|_{L^\infty} \geq o(1) + \int_M \dif A \wedge \varphi$$
and we can write any $1$-form in the unit sphere of $L^1$ as a (possibly infinite) convex combination in $L^1$ of approximations to plaquette currents so this estimate is sharp.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sup_{x \in M} L(A, x) = L(A)$.
\item If $A$ is an $\infty$-magnetic potential, then $A$ has best curl.
\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

I doubt that the converse should be true, because even though the global curl modulus has Morse index zero, it is a nonlocal energy, while the condition for being an $\infty$-magnetic potential is local (at least if $A \in C^2$), namely the $\infty$-Maxwell equation.



\begin{theorem}
For each dyadic $4 \leq p < \infty$, let $A_p$ be the $p$-magnetic potential on a $U(1)$ line bundle $\mathscr F$, which we assume to be in Coulomb gauge.
Then there exists a connection $A$ in Coulomb gauge on $\mathscr F$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Along a subsequence, $A_p \to A$ uniformly and $\dif A_p \to \dif A$ weakly in $L^q$ for any $3 < q < \infty$.
\item $A$ has absolutely best curl.
\item One has 
$$\|A\|_{W^{1, \infty}} \lesssim |c_1(\mathscr F)|.$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We roughly follow \cite[\S3]{Lindqvist14}.
Let $q > 3$, and let $B$ be a connection on $\mathscr F$.
By H\"older's inequality and (\ref{infinity magnetic rules p magnetic}),
\begin{equation}\label{uniform bounds in p by best curl}
	\|\dif A_p\|_{L^q} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{p}} \|\dif A_p\|_{L^p} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{p}} \|\dif B\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}
Then a compactness argument gives $\dif A_p \to F$ for some $2$-form $F$, weakly in $L^q$, and by Fatou's lemma, 
$$\|F\|_{L^q} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{q}} \|\dif B\|_{L^\infty}.$$
Diagonalizing, we may assume that $\dif A_p \to F$ weakly in $L^q$ for every such $q$, and taking $q \to \infty$, we conclude 
\begin{equation}\label{infinity magnetics have best curl}
	\|F\|_{L^\infty} \leq \|\dif B\|_{L^\infty}.
\end{equation}

We now compute the cohomology class of $F$.
Since $\dif F = 0$ and
$$\|F\|_{L^4} \leq |M|^{\frac{1}{4}} \|F\|_{L^\infty},$$
$\dif A_p \to F$ weakly in $W^{1, 4} \Omega^2$.
So by the trace theorem, along any $2$-cycle $S$, the pullbacks of $\dif A_p$ converge to the (well-defined) pullback of $F$ weakly in $W^{-\frac{1}{4}, 4}(S, \Omega^2)$.
Thus for any smooth function $\psi$ on $S$,
$$\int_S \psi F = \lim_{p \to \infty} \int_S \psi \dif A_p,$$
and taking $\psi = 1$ we obtain 
$$\int_S F = \lim_{p \to \infty} 2\pi \langle c_1(\mathscr F), [S] \rangle = 2\pi \langle c_1(\mathscr F), [S]\rangle,$$
where $[S] \in H_2(M, \ZZ)$ denotes the homology class of $S$.
Therefore $F$ is the curvature of a connection $A$ on $\mathscr F$, \todo{which must have best curl} since $B$ was arbitrary in (\ref{infinity magnetics have best curl}).

We now estimate using the Sobolev embedding theorem and (\ref{uniform bounds in p by best curl})
$$\|A_p\|_{C^{\frac{1}{4}}} \lesssim \|A_p\|_{W^{1, 4}} \lesssim \|\dif A_p\|_{L^4} \lesssim |M|^{\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{p}} \|\dif A\|_{L^\infty}$$
for $p \geq 4$.
Passing to a further subsequence, we obtain $A_p \to A$ uniformly, and in particular that $A$ is in Coulomb gauge.

\todo{It remains to show that $A$ has not only best curl, but absolutely best curl. Also the bound in terms of Chern class}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Infinity maxwell equation}

\begin{proposition}[$\infty$-Maxwell equation]
Let $A$ be an $\infty$-magnetic potential with regularity $C^2$, and $F := \dif A$. Then 
$$F^{ij} \partial_i |F|^2 = 0.$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
It follows from the Euler-Lagrange-Aronsson formula \cite[Theorem 5.2]{Barron2001} and chain rule bashing that
$$F^{ij} F^{ab} \nabla_i F_{ab} = 0$$
since $p$-magnetic potentials are absolute minimizers.
The claim now follows because $\nabla$ is a metric connection and $|F|^2$ is a scalar field.
\end{proof}

However, the regularity hypothesis and the fact that the $\infty$-Maxwell equation is highly degenerate means that this proposition seems pretty useless.
It might be useful indirectly though.
For example it seems to follow that $F$ is covariantly constant in the directions cotangent to $F$ though I don't know how to make this precise.

\subsection{Weak solutions}
Let $A$ be a classical solution of $\infty$-Maxwell. Since $\nabla$ is a metric connection, it is equivalent that 
$$F^{ij} \partial_i |F|^2 = 0$$
Since $A$ is classical, we can find a $C^1$ orthonormal frame in which the $(1, 1)$-tensor $(F^i_j)$ is
$$F = \begin{bmatrix}& 1 \\ -1 \\ && 0\end{bmatrix}$$
and in this frame the $\infty$-Maxwell system becomes 
$$\partial_1 |F|^2 = \partial_2 |F|^2 = 0$$
or in other words $\dif(|F|^2)$ is parallel to $\partial_3$ which is parallel to $(\star F)^\flat$.
It follows that
$$\dif(|\dif A|^2) \wedge \dif A = 0.$$
Multiplying by a test function and integrating by parts, this is equivalent to 
$$\int_M |\dif A|^2 \dif A \wedge \dif \psi = 0$$
for every test function $\psi$ which is the condition of weak solution for $\infty$-Maxwell.
It makes sense for any $A \in W^{1, 3, 1}$.

\begin{conjecture}
Every $\infty$-magnetic form (in the sense of $p$-approximation) is $\infty$-magnetic in the $W^{1, 3, 1}$ weak sense.
\end{conjecture}

\subsection{Not every best curl form is infinity magnetic}
\begin{example}
For the Neumann problem 
$$\begin{cases}
\dif(|\dif A|^2) \wedge \dif A = 0 \\
\iota^*(\dif A) = \iota^*(\dif x \wedge \dif y)
\end{cases}$$
on $\Ball^3$, the solution is $x \dif y$. For the Neumann problem with zero data the solution is $0$.
However, if we take two disjoint copies of $\Ball^3$, we can take $\tilde A$ to be any compactly supported form on $\Ball^3$ with $\|\dif \tilde A\|_{L^\infty} \leq 1$, and then if we put $\tilde A$ on the copy with zero Neumann data, and $x \dif y$ on the copy with nontrivial Neumann data, then clearly the disjoint union form $A$ has best curl, but also we may choose $\tilde A$ so that it is not $\infty$-magnetic.

I think by taking a connected sum of these two balls (the interior of a dumbbell) with a long enough connector, you could replicate this with a connected $3$-manifold.
You'd probably want to consider the Dirichlet problem with data $\iota^*(x \dif y)$ and $0$ though, so that you don't have to solve the compatibility condition of $\dif \iota* F = 0$ to glue together the two Neumann data.
\end{example}


\subsection{Scaling considerations}
The two minimization problems in consideration are invariant under two scalings: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Rescale the entire manifold. Since $\int_\sigma F$ is a topological invariant this works, and in particular it changes $\|F\|_{L^\infty}$ but not the cohomology class of $F$.
\item $A \mapsto \lambda A$ (since $\infty$-Maxwell is homogeneous cubic). This changes both $\|F\|_{L^\infty}$ and the cohomology class of $F$.
\end{enumerate}
In particular, by applying both scalings, we may impose $\|F\|_{L^\infty} = 1$ and $F \in H^2(M, \ZZ)$ simultaneously.
So we may view $F$ as a curvature on the line bundle $L$ whose Chern class is $c_1(L) := F$, and this is why we may use the gauge theoretic formalism of $F = \dif A$.

\subsection{The Neumann problem}
Recall from homological finite element methods:

\begin{definition}
Let $1 < p < \infty$.
The \dfn{de Rham-Sobolev complex} consists of Banach spaces $W^{1, p, \ell}$, $\ell \in \{0, \dots, 3\}$, of $\ell$-forms characterized by the norm 
$$\|\alpha\|_{W^{1, p, \ell}}^p := \|\alpha\|_{L^p}^p + \|\dif \alpha\|_{L^p}^p$$
and boundary maps 
$$\dif: W^{1, p, \ell} \to W^{1, p, \ell + 1}.$$
We also set $W^{1, p, -1} = W^{1, p, 4} = 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[trace theorem]
We have surjective trace maps
\begin{align*}
\tr_0: W^{1, p, 0}(M) &\to W^{1 - 1/p, p}(\partial M) \\
\tr_1: W^{1, p, 1}(M) &\to W^{-1/p, p}(\partial M, \Omega^1) \\
\tr_2: W^{1, p, 2}(M) &\to W^{-1/p, p}(\partial M, \Omega^2)
\end{align*}
characterized by the fact that on continuous forms they correspond to pullback by the natural map 
$$\iota: \partial M \to M$$
and where $W^{s, p}(N, \mathcal F)$ is defined for a $C^\infty$-locally free sheaf $\mathcal F$ on a manifold $N$, and $s \in \RR$, $1 < p < \infty$, using Fourier integral calculus in the usual way.
In particular, $\tr_\ell \cdot \dif = \dif \circ \tr_{\ell - 1}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Idea]
In homological FEM, the normal trace of $H(div)(M)$ fields is $W^{-1/2, 2}(\partial M, \Omega^1)$.
If $F \in H(div)(M)$ then $F \in W^{1, 2, 2}(M)$ and $F \cdot \normal = \iota^* F$ where $\iota: \partial M \to M$.
Similarly, the tangential trace of $H(curl)(M)$ fields is $W^{-1/2, 2}(\partial M, \Omega^2)$, and $A \times \normal = \iota^* A$.
I guess surjectivity should be in the FEM literature somewhere.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
The \dfn{pure gauge part} of a form $A \in L^p(M, \Omega^1)$ is the projection of $A$ onto closed forms.
\end{definition}

This is well-defined for $M$ closed by ``Lp theory of differential forms'' (and probably in general if we have some boundary data).

\begin{proposition}[Sobolev embedding theorem]
For $3 < p < \infty$ and $0 \leq \ell \leq 3$, any $\alpha \in W^{1, p, \ell}$ can be written as the sum of an element of $C^{1 - 3/p}(M, \Omega^\ell)$ plus a pure gauge part.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Idea]
By elliptic regularity and Sobolev 
$$\|\alpha\|_{C^{1 - 3/p}(M, \Omega^\ell)} \lesssim \|\alpha\|_{W^{1, p}(M, \Omega^\ell)} \lesssim \|\alpha\|_{W^{1, p, \ell}(M)}$$
if we assume that the pure gauge part is $0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[solving the Neumann problem]
Let $J \in L^\infty(\partial M, \Omega^2)$ and suppose that $\partial M$ is a closed surface.
Then there exists an $\infty$-magnetic potential $A$ such that $\dif \iota^* A = J$ as distributions on $\partial M$, and
$$\|A\|_{W^{1, \infty, 1}}(M) \lesssim \|J\|_{L^\infty(\partial M)}.$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Let $3 < p < \infty$. The second variation of the $p$-Maxwell energy at a form $A_p$ in a direction $B$ is bounded from below by
$$(p - 2) \langle \dif A_p, \dif B\rangle^2 + |\dif A_p|^2 \cdot |\dif B|^2 \geq 0$$
so the Morse index of the $p$-Maxwell energy at $A_p$ is $0$.
Since $\partial M$ is compact, the natural map $L^\infty \to L^p$ is bounded, and then surjectivity of the trace map implies that if $\tr_2(\dif A_p) = J$ then
$$\|A_p\|_{W^{1, p, 1}} \lesssim \|\dif A_p\|_{L^p} + \|J\|_{L^\infty} + \|G\|_{L^p}$$
where $G$ is the pure gauge part of $A_p$, and these bounds are independent of $p$.
\S8.2.1 of Evans, modified to account for a pure gauge part, implies that the direct method furnishes a $p$-magnetic potential $A_p$ with
$$\|A_p\|_{W^{1, p, 1}} \lesssim \|J\|_{L^\infty} + \|G\|_{L^p}.$$
Sobolev implies that $A_p$ is eventually bounded modulo gauge in $C^\theta$ for any $0 \leq \theta < 1$ and in $W^{1, q, 1}$ for any $1 < q < \infty$.
In particular, $A_p \to A$ in $C^\theta$ and weakstar $W^{1, q, 1}$ along a subsequence.
So $A$ is $\infty$-magnetic and satisfies the right estimates once we solve away the gauge and take $q \to \infty$.
Also $\iota^* A$ has regularity $C^\theta \subseteq L^2$ so $\dif (\iota^* A)$ makes sense as an element of $W^{-1, 2}$.
Since clearly $A_p \to A$ in $L^2$ and $L^\infty \subseteq W^{-1, 2}$ we deduce from $\dif(\iota^* A_p) = \tr_2(\dif A_p) = J$ the boundary claim.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Elliptic regularity}
\begin{proposition}[elliptic regularity]
Let $A$ be an $\infty$-magnetic potential.
Then there exists a gauge transformation of $A$ whose components are Lipschitz.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
For $3 < p < \infty$, let $\tilde A_p \to A$ solve the Dirichlet problem
$$\begin{cases}
	\dif^*(|\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p) = 0 \\
	\dif^* A_p = 0 \\
	\iota^* A_p = \iota^* \tilde A_p
\end{cases}.$$
Proceeding as above we get
$$\|A_p\|_{W^{1, p}(M, \Omega^1)} \lesssim \|A_p\|_{W^{1, p, 1}} \lesssim \|\iota^* \tilde A_p\|_{L^p(\partial M)} \lesssim \|\tilde A_p\|_{W^{1, p, 1}} \lesssim \|A\|_{C^0}.$$
Using the second variation of the $p$-Maxwell energy and the $L^p$ Hodge theorem, we get a uniqueness theorem: $A_p = \tilde A_p$ modulo pure gauge.
The closed $1$-forms are a closed subset of $W^{1, p}$ I think. So $A_p \to A$ plus gauge.
But also $\|A\|_{W^{1, \infty}(M, \Omega)} \lesssim \|A\|_{C^0}$.
\end{proof}

Since we can recover $A_p$ from $A$ (can we?) it should follow that $A$ is as unique as $A_p$ is.

\section{The maximum curl locus}
\begin{lemma}
Let $A$ be $\infty$-magnetic, let $N$ be a hypersurface, and suppose that $\dif A$ is co-bitangent to $N$, that is, $\iota_{\normal_N} \dif A = 0$.
Then $N$ is minimal.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $A$ is $\infty$-magnetic, if $V$ is tangent to $N$, then (since $V$ is normal to $\normal_N$)
$$V(|\dif A|^2) = 0.$$
You can make this precise using the weak formulation if you really want to.
In particular, $|\dif A|$ is constant along $N$, and without loss of generality it is $1$.
It follows that $\dif A$ is the area form on $N$, so $\star \dif A = (-1)^s \normal_N^\flat$.
Then 
\begin{align*}
H_N &= \tr(\nabla \normal_N) = (-1)^{s_1} \dif^* \star \dif A = (-1)^{s_2} \dif^2 A = 0. \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

Now let $S$ be the maximum curl locus of $A$.
By upper semicontinuity, $S$ is a nonempty closed set.
If $V, W$ satisfy $V|\dif A| = W|\dif A| = 0$, then $[V, W]|\dif A| = 0$.
If this can be made sense of in the `weak' framework it follows from Frobenius that $S$ is minimally immersed.


\subsection{Calibration theory}
Here's another way to prove something similar to the above theorem:

\begin{lemma}
Let $F \in L^\infty(M, \Omega^2)$ satisfy $\|F\|_{L^\infty} = 1$ and $\dif F = 0$.
Then $F$ is a calibration.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $V$ be a $2$-dimensional subbundle of $TM$; we must show that $F|_V$ is a multiple of the volume form of $V$.
Actually $F|_V$ is the projection of $F$ to the rank-$1$, $C^\infty$-locally free sheaf $H^0(M, V' \wedge V')$, and since it's rank-$1$ we win.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
Suppose that $\|F\|_{L^\infty} = 1$, and $F = \dif A$ where $A$ has best curl.
Then there is a minimal lamination whose leaves are calibrated submanifolds for $F$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Modify \cite[Theorem 5.1]{bangert_cui_2017} to deal with the analytic niceties.
Note that \cite{bangert_cui_2017} assumes that de Giorgi's lemma extends from euclidean space to manifolds, and doesn't seem to bound the curvature of the leaves...
\end{proof}

\section{The dual one-harmonic function}
For simplicity let's assume $H^2(M, \ZZ) = 0$.

Let $A$ be an $\infty$-magnetic potential and let $A_p \to A$ witness that $A$ is $\infty$-magnetic.
For simplicity we assume that $\|\dif A\|_{L^\infty} = 1$, that is $F := \dif A$ is a calibration.
Let $3 < p < \infty$, $1/p + 1/q = 1$ (so $1 < q < 3/2$) and
$$\int_M \star |k_p \dif A_p|^p = k_p$$
just like in \cite[\S3.2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Let $F_p := k_p \dif A_p$ and $U_q := |F_p|^{p - 2} \star F_p$ which is a $1$-form.
Then 
$$\dif A_p \wedge U_q = k_p^{-1} \int_M \star |F_p|^p = 1.$$
Also 
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} k_p^{\frac{1}{p} - 1} = \lim_{p \to \infty} \|\dif A_p\|_{L^p} = \|F\|_{L^\infty} = 1.$$
It follows that $k_p \to 1$.
Finally, we have $\|U_q\|_{L^1} \to 1$, which implies that $U_q \to U$ in the weak topology of measures for some closed $2$-current $U$.
Then $U = \dif u$ for some $u \in BV(M)$.
By the Fenchel relations, $\dif^*(|U_q|^{q - 2} U_q) = 0$, and $\dif U_q = 0$.
So by the Maz\'on-Rosser-Segura de Le\'on theorem, $u$ is $1$-harmonic.

Question: Does the Fenchel relation imply that $u$ is nonzero?
What about nonconstant?
\cite{bangert_cui_2017} implies that there exists $U$ which is calibrated by $F$, and then $U = \dif \tilde u$, but it doesn't seem clear that this $\tilde u$ should be the same as $U$, maybe the uniqueness part of the M-R-SdL theorem explains this.

\begin{lemma}
For any $\theta \in (0, 1)$,
	$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \int_{\{|F| \leq \theta\}} \star |F_p|^p = 0.$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Integrating the $p$-Maxwell equation 
$$\dif^*(|\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p) = 0$$
by parts 
\begin{align*}
	0 &= \int_M \dif \star (|\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p) \wedge (A_p - A) \\
	&= \int_{\partial M} \star(|\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p) \wedge \iota^* (A_p - A) - \int_M \star (|\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p) \wedge \dif (A_p - A).
\end{align*}
Here $\iota^* (A_p - A)$ is well-defined because $A_p - A \in C^0$.
I guess that $|\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p$ should have a trace as well, otherwise we need some kind of smooth approximation.
Let $J$ be the Neumann data, then 
$$\dif \iota^*(A_p - A) = J - J = 0$$
so $\iota^*(A_p - A)$ is pure gauge. In particular, since we may modify the $p$-approximations $A_p$ up to gauge without affecting the result, we may assume that $\iota^*(A_p - A) = 0$.
Therefore 
$$\int_M |\dif A_p|^{p - 2} \dif A_p \wedge \star \dif (A_p - A) = 0.$$

We now proceed as in \cite[Lemma 6.3]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}.
Let $f(p) := \langle F_p, F_p - F\rangle$ and $Y_p := \{f(p) \geq 0\}$.
Rescaling by $k_p^p$, 
$$\int_M |F_p|^{p - 2} F_p \wedge \star (F_p - k_p F) = 0$$
so 
\begin{align*}
	\lim_{p \to \infty} \int_M |F_p|^{p - 2} F_p \wedge \star (F_p - k_p F) - \star f(p) 
	&= \lim_{p \to \infty} \int_M |F_p|^{p - 2} F_p \wedge \star (F - k_p F) \\
	&\leq \lim_{p \to \infty} (1 - k_p) \int_M |F_p|^{p - 1} \star |F| = 0.
\end{align*}
Therefore 
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \int_M |F_p|^{p - 2} \star f(p) = 0.$$
On the other hand, on $M \setminus Y_p$ we have by the elementary \cite[Lemma 6.2]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} that 
$$
	-2|F_p|^{p - 2} f(p) \leq |F_p|^{p - 2} (|F|^2 - |F_p|^2) < \frac{2}{p - 2}
$$
which implies 
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \int_{M \setminus Y_p} |F_p|^{p - 2} \star f(p) = 0.$$
Therefore 
$$\lim_{p \to \infty} \int_{Y_p} |F_p|^{p - 2} \star f(p) = 0.$$

To finish the proof we look to \cite[Proposition 6.5]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}...
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
$\supp \dif v$ is contained in the calibrated lamination associated to any best curl form with the same data as $A$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By as in \cite[Theorem 6.1]{daskalopoulos2020transverse}, $\supp \dif v \subseteq \{|F| = \|F\|_{L^\infty}\}$.
Actually, as in \cite[Corollary 6.8]{daskalopoulos2020transverse} the same argument works as long as $F = \dif \tilde A$ where $\tilde A$ is a best curl competitor of $A$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Thurston's K-L theorem}
\begin{conjecture}
For $\sigma$ a closed $2$-chain, let
$$K(\sigma) := \frac{1}{|\sigma|} \int_\sigma \dif A$$
and let $K := \sup_\sigma K(\sigma)$, where $A$ has best curl (so is only locally a $1$-form).
Let $L$ be the best curl constant. Then $K = L$.
\end{conjecture}

This holds if the calibrated lamination has a closed leaf.
If it doesn't, how can we deform it to have a closed leaf?
