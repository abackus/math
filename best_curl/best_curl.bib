abstract = {Whitney forms are widely known as finite elements for differential forms. Whitney’s original definition yields first order functions on simplicial complexes, and a lot of research has been devoted to extending the definition to nonsimplicial cells and higher order functions. As a result, the term Whitney forms has become somewhat ambiguous in the literature. Our aim here is to clarify the concept of Whitney forms and explicitly explain their key properties. We discuss Whitney’s initial definition with more depth than usually, giving three equivalent ways to define Whitney forms. We give a comprehensive exposition of their main properties, including the proofs. Understanding of these properties is important as they can be taken as a guideline on how to extend Whitney forms to nonsimplicial cells or higher order functions. We discuss several generalisations of Whitney forms and check which of the properties can be preserved.}

Does this function always have a canonical optimal Lipschitz extension to all of U? We propose a notion of optimal Lipschitz extension and address existence and uniqueness in some special cases. In the case n = m = 2, we show that smooth solutions have two phases: in one they are conformal and in the other they are variants of infinity harmonic functions called infinity harmonic fans. We also prove existence and uniqueness for the extension problem on finite graphs. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Refining recent results of Bergeron, {\c{S}}eng{\"u}n, and Venkatesh as well as older work of Kronheimer and Mrowka, we show that these norms are roughly proportional with explicit constants depending only on the volume and injectivity radius of the hyperbolic 3-manifold itself. Moreover, we give families of examples showing that some (but not all) qualitative aspects of our estimates are sharp. Finally, we exhibit closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds where the Thurston norm grows exponentially in terms of the volume and yet there is a uniform lower bound on the injectivity radius.},

 abstract = {The infinity Laplace equation $\Delta _{\infty }u=0$ arose originally as a sort of Euler-Lagrange equation governing the absolute minimizer for the $L^{\infty}$ variational problem of minimizing the functional $\text{ess}-\text{sup}_{U}|Du|$ . The more general functional $\text{ess}-\text{sup}_{U}F(x,u,Du)$ leads similarly to the so-called Aronsson equation $A_{F}[u]=0$ . In this paper we show that these PDE operators and various interesting generalizations also appear in several other contexts seemingly quite unrelated to $L^{\infty}$ variational problems, including two-person game theory with random order of play, rapid switching of states in control problems, etc. The resulting equations can be parabolic and inhomogeneous, equation types precluded in conventional $L^{\infty}$ variational problems.},

abstract = {We propose a new notion called infinity-harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds. These are natural generalizations of the well-known notion of infinity-harmonic functions and are also the limiting case of p-harmonic maps as p→∞. Infinity-harmonicity appears in many familiar contexts. For example, metric projection onto the orbit of an isometric group action from a tubular neighborhood is infinity-harmonic. Unfortunately, infinity-harmonicity is not preserved under composition. Those infinity-harmonic maps that always preserve infinity-harmonicity under pull back are called infinity-harmonic morphisms. We show that infinity-harmonic morphisms are precisely horizontally homothetic maps. Many examples of infinity-harmonic maps are also given, including some very important and well-known classes of maps between Riemannian manifolds.}

In particular, we show that a R-homologically nontrivial connected submanifold M of a smooth Riemannian manifold X is homologically mass-minimizing for some metrics in the same conformal class. Moreover, several generalizations for M with multiple connected components or for a mutually disjoint collection (see §3.5) are obtained. For a submanifold with certain singularities, we also establish an extension theorem for generating global calibration pairs. By combining these results, we find that, in some Riemannian manifolds, there are homologically mass-minimizing smooth submanifolds which cannot be calibrated by any smooth calibration.}
