    <h1>Math 185</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Math 185 with Prof. Klass!</p>
    <p><b>Instructor:</b> The Professor of the course is Prof. Micheal Klass (klass@stat.berkeley.edu).</p>
    <p><b>UGSI:</b> I, Aidan Backus (aidanbackus@berkeley.edu), am the UGSI of the course.</p>
    <p><b>Reading:</b> We have the following reading material. Please let me know if you need help acquiring a copy of any of these books.
<ul>
  <li>I keep a record of <a href="math185.pdf">course notes</a>, which I update as time permits. These will often go into more detail than what we have time to cover in class.</li>
  <li>The official course textbook is Marsden and Hoffman's "Basic Complex Analysis." This is also the book that the homework will be based on.</li>
  <li>Another good book is Saranson's "Lectures on Complex Function Theory."</li>
  <li>Brown and Churchill's "Complex Variables with Applications" is another good reference.</li>
  <li>I have my <a href="https://musa.berkeley.edu/resources/math185.pdf">notes from when I took complex analysis</a> but they will cover somewhat different material than what Prof. Klass has planned. In particular, there are certain topics in these notes that we will cover in much less depth, so caveat lector!</li>
</ul>  </p>
    <p><b>Midterm</b>: Monday, 21 October. It will cover the first two chapters of Marsden-Hoffman. Everything that will be covered on the midterm will already be in the course notes as of Tuesday, 8 October. We also have a <a href="Math_185_Midterm.pdf">practice midterm</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Course policies:</b> Please direct all enrollment questions to Jennifer Sixt Pinney (enrollment@math.berkeley.edu). I cannot answer them. As for grading, your grade will be based 50 percent on the final, 25 percent on the midterm, and 25 percent on homework. But if your grade is borderline, turning in a thought journal may boost your grade, as will having good attendance and participation. Homework will be due on Fridays.</p>
    <p><b>Course description:</b> The official course description is <q>Analytic functions of a complex variable. Cauchy's integral theorem, power series, Laurent series, singularities of analytic functions, the residue theorem with application to definite integrals. Some additional topics such as conformal mapping.</q> This course can be thought of as a "sequel" to Math 53 in the following sense: in Math 53, you considered line integrals of functions <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> → <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>. These can be also thought of us as functions <b>C</b> → <b>C</b>. If a function <b>C</b> → <b>C</b> satisfies a very innocent-looking condition called "holomorphy", then it automatically solves a certain differential equation, automatically equals its own Taylor series, is automatically conservative, and much more. For example, to compute the value of the function at a point, one just needs to find an average in a ball around that point. Miraculously, the functions you learned about in high school <b>R</b> → <b>R</b> extend to holomorphic functions, and so we can use complex analysis to solve problems in single-variable calculus.</p>
    <p><b>Office Hours:</b> Prof. Klass will hold office hours after class in 319 Evans, or by appointment. I will also hold office hours in 938 Evans: Wednesday 11-12 and Friday 10-11. I also hold office hours by appointment.</p>
    <p><b>Homework:</b> Homework will be posted here weekly, and due on Friday. Numered exercises are from Marsden and Hoffman. You are encouraged (but not required) to use LaTeX. If this is your first time using LaTeX, you might base your assignments on <a href="https://v2.overleaf.com/read/hvnmvqfbtbyk">this template</a>.
