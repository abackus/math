abstract = {Abstract Consider a bounded open set \$\font\open=msbm10 at 10pt\def\R{\hbox{\open R}}U \subset \R^n\$ and a Lipschitz function \$\font\open=msbm10 at 10pt\def\R{\hbox{\open R}}g: \partial U \to \R^m\$. Does this function always have a canonical optimal Lipschitz extension to all of U? We propose a notion of optimal Lipschitz extension and address existence and uniqueness in some special cases. In the case n = m = 2, we show that smooth solutions have two phases: in one they are conformal and in the other they are variants of infinity harmonic functions called infinity harmonic fans. We also prove existence and uniqueness for the extension problem on finite graphs. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider the continuous piecewise linear finite element approximation of the following problem: Given p ∈ (1, ∞), f, and g, find u such that $-\Delta \cdot (|\Delta u|^{p - 2}\Delta u) = f \text{in} \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2,\quad u = g \text{on} \partial\Omega.$ The finite element approximation is defined over Ωh, a union of regular triangles, yielding a polygonal approximation to Ω. For sufficiently regular solutions u, achievable for a subclass of data f, g, and Ω, we prove optimal error bounds for this approximation in the norm W1, q(Ωh), q = p for $p < 2$ and q ∈ [ 1, 2 ] for $p > 2$, under the additional assumption that $\Omega^h \subseteq \Omega$. Numerical results demonstrating these bounds are also presented.},

We prove convergence of the solution of the Wide Stencil finite difference schemes to the unique viscosity solution of the underlying equation. We build a semi-implicit solver, which solves the Laplace equation as each step. It is fast in the sense that the number of iterations is independent of the problem size. This is an improvement over previous explicit solvers, which are slow due to the CFL condition.}
